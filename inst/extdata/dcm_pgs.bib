  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To characterize the individual-level agreement of CHD PRSs that perform similarly at the population level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study of participants from diverse backgrounds enrolled in the All of Us Research Program (AOU), Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) ATLAS Precision Health Biobank with electronic health record and genotyping data. EXPOSURES Polygenic risk for CHD from published PRSs and new PRSs developed separately from testing samples. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES PRSs that performed population-level prediction similarly were identified by comparing calibration and discrimination of models of prevalent CHD. Individual-level agreement was tested with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Light {$\kappa$}. RESULTS A total of 48 PRSs were calculated for 171 095 AOU participants. The mean (SD) age was 56.4 (16.8) years. A total of 104 947 participants (61.3\%) were female. A total of 35 590 participants (20.8\%) were most genetically similar to an African reference population, 29 801 (17.4\%) to an admixed American reference population, 100 493 (58.7\%) to a European reference population, and the remaining to Central/South Asian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern reference populations. There were 17 589 participants (10.3\%) with and 153 506 participants without (89.7\%) CHD. When included in a model of prevalent CHD, 46 scores had practically equivalent Brier scores and area under the receiver operator curves (region of practical equivalence {\textpm}0.02). Twenty percent of participants had at least 1 score in both the top and bottom 5\% of risk. Continuous agreement of individual predictions was poor (ICC, 0.373 [95\% CI, 0.372-0.375]). Light {$\kappa$}, used to evaluate consistency of risk assignment, did not exceed 0.56. Analysis among 41 193 PMBB and 53 092 ATLAS participants yielded different sets of equivalent scores, which also lacked individual-level agreement. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE CHD PRSs that performed similarly at the population level demonstrated highly variable individual-level estimates of risk. Recognizing that CHD PRSs may generate incongruent individual-level risk estimates, effective clinical implementation will require refined statistical methods to quantify uncertainty and new strategies to communicate this uncertainty to patients and clinicians.},

  abstract = {, Over the last decade, great progress has been made in defining the genetic basis of AF. Common variants have been identified at more than 100 genetic loci, and rare mutations have implicated many genes in AF. However, the relative contribution of rare and common genetic variants to AF risk remains unclear. The population-based UK Biobank provides a unique opportunity to assess the genetic contributions to AF risk. In an exome wide analysis, we found that LOF mutations in TTN were strongly associated with AF risk and were highly penetrant. A polygenic risk score of common variants explains a great proportion of AF risk than mutations in TTN. Among TTN mutation carriers, it would be interesting in future work to determine if a subtle cardiomyopathy is present by cardiac imaging or to examine the progression to heart failure or other AF co-morbidities.},

  abstract = {A polygenic score (PGS) or polygenic risk score (PRS) is an estimate of an individual's genetic liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation---genetic liability---has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) is of utmost importance. Although genetic studies have identified AD-associated SNPs in APOE and other genes, genetic information has not been integrated into an epidemiological framework for risk prediction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP Stage 1), we identified AD-associated SNPs (at p {$<$} 10-5). We then integrated these AD-associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazard model using genotype data from a subset of 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), providing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for each participant. By combining population-based incidence rates and the genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age, and tested replication in multiple independent cohorts (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Center [NIA ADC], and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], total n = 20,680). Within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among APOE {$\varepsilon$}3/3 individuals, the PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10 y between the lowest and highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95\% CI 2.62-4.24, p = 1.0 {\texttimes} 10-22). In independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (ADGC Phase 2, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 {\texttimes} 10-26) and longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD (NIA ADC, Cochran-Armitage trend test, p = 1.5 {\texttimes} 10-10), and was associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles, p = 3.9 {\texttimes} 10-6, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score for neuritic plaques, p = 6.8 {\texttimes} 10-6) and in vivo markers of AD neurodegeneration (ADNI, volume loss within the entorhinal cortex, p = 6.3 {\texttimes} 10-6, and hippocampus, p = 7.9 {\texttimes} 10-5). Additional prospective validation of these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based cohorts is necessary before clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a PHS for quantifying individual differences in age-specific genetic risk for AD. Within the cohorts studied here, polygenic architecture plays an important role in modifying AD risk beyond APOE. With thorough validation, quantification of inherited genetic variation may prove useful for stratifying AD risk and as an enrichment strategy in therapeutic trials.},

  abstract = {Although rare neurodevelopmental conditions have a large Mendelian component1, common genetic variants also contribute to risk2,3. However, little is known about how this polygenic risk is distributed among patients with these conditions and their parents nor its interplay with rare variants. It is also unclear whether polygenic background affects risk directly through alleles transmitted from parents to children, or whether indirect genetic effects mediated through the family environment4 also play a role. Here we addressed these questions using genetic data from 11,573 patients with rare neurodevelopmental conditions, 9,128 of their parents and 26,869 controls. Common variants explained around 10\% of variance in risk. Patients with a monogenic diagnosis had significantly less polygenic risk than those without, supporting a liability threshold model5. A polygenic score for neurodevelopmental conditions showed only a direct genetic effect. By contrast, polygenic scores for educational attainment and cognitive performance showed no direct genetic effect, but the non-transmitted alleles in the parents were correlated with the child's risk, potentially due to indirect genetic effects and/or parental assortment for these traits4. Indeed, as expected under parental assortment, we show that common variant predisposition for neurodevelopmental conditions is correlated with the rare variant component of risk. These findings indicate that future studies should investigate the possible role and nature of indirect genetic effects on rare neurodevelopmental conditions, and consider the contribution of common and rare variants simultaneously when studying cognition-related phenotypes.},

In addition to providing causal insights into disease, these endeavours have yielded and enabled the refinement of polygenic risk scores. These scores can be used to predict incident coronary artery disease in multiple cohorts and indicate the clinical response to some preventive therapies in post hoc analyses of clinical trials. These observations and the widespread ability to calculate polygenic risk scores from direct-to-consumer and health-care-associated biobanks have raised many questions about responsible clinical adoption. In this Review, we describe technical and downstream considerations for the derivation and validation of polygenic risk scores and current evidence for their efficacy and safety. We discuss the implementation of these scores in clinical medicine for uses including risk prediction and screening algorithms for coronary artery disease, prioritization of patient subgroups that are likely to derive benefit from treatment, and efficient prospective clinical trial designs.},

  abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 94 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer (BC) risk and 18 associated with ovarian cancer (OC) risk. Several of these are also associated with risk of BC or OC for women who carry a pathogenic mutation in the high-risk BC and OC genes BRCA1 or BRCA2. The combined effects of these variants on BC or OC risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have not yet been assessed while their clinical management could benefit from improved personalized risk estimates.,  Methods: We constructed polygenic risk scores (PRS) using BC and OC susceptibility SNPs identified through population-based GWAS: for BC (overall, estrogen receptor [ER]--positive, and ER-negative) and for OC. Using data from 15 252 female BRCA1 and 8211 BRCA2 carriers, the association of each PRS with BC or OC risk was evaluated using a weighted cohort approach, with time to diagnosis as the outcome and estimation of the hazard ratios (HRs) per standard deviation increase in the PRS.,  Results: The PRS for ER-negative BC displayed the strongest association with BC risk in BRCA1 carriers (HR\,=\,1.27, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23 to 1.31, P\,=\,8.2{\texttimes}10-53). In BRCA2 carriers, the strongest association with BC risk was seen for the overall BC PRS (HR\,=\,1.22, 95\% CI\,=\,1.17 to 1.28, P\,=\,7.2{\texttimes}10-20). The OC PRS was strongly associated with OC risk for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. These translate to differences in absolute risks (more than 10\% in each case) between the top and bottom deciles of the PRS distribution; for example, the OC risk was 6\% by age 80 years for BRCA2 carriers at the 10th percentile of the OC PRS compared with 19\% risk for those at the 90th percentile of PRS.,  Conclusions: BC and OC PRS are predictive of cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Incorporation of the PRS into risk prediction models has promise to better inform decisions on cancer risk management.},

Early findings, however, revealed a more complex genetic architecture than was anticipated for most common diseases --- complexity that seemed to limit the immediate utility of these findings. As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information. Nevertheless, recent efforts have begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify groups of individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease. In this context, we review the evidence supporting the personal and clinical utility of polygenic risk profiling.},

  abstract = {Analyses of data from genome-wide association studies on unrelated individuals have shown that, for human traits and diseases, approximately one-third to two-thirds of heritability is captured by common SNPs. However, it is not known whether the remaining heritability is due to the imperfect tagging of causal variants by common SNPs, in particular whether the causal variants are rare, or whether it is overestimated due to bias in inference from pedigree data. Here we estimated heritability for height and body mass index (BMI) from whole-genome sequence data on 25,465 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. The estimated heritability was 0.68 (standard error 0.10) for height and 0.30 (standard error 0.10) for body mass index. Low minor allele frequency variants in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) with neighboring variants were enriched for heritability, to a greater extent for protein-altering variants, consistent with negative selection. Our results imply that rare variants, in particular those in regions of low linkage disequilibrium, are a major source of the still missing heritability of complex traits and disease.},

  abstract = {Many risk factors for disease are suggested as screening tests when there is little prospect that they could be useful in predicting disease. To avoid this, it is useful to know the relationship between the relative risk of a disease or disorder in people with high and low values of a risk factor, and the equivalent screening performance in terms of the detection rate (sensitivity) for a specified false-positive rate. We describe an interactive Risk-Screening Converter, accessible from the Internet (http://www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/rsc/), that transforms an odds ratio into the equivalent estimates of detection and false-positive rates. The converter is intended for general clinicians, for people engaged in research into risk factors and disease, and for those who give advice on applying such research findings into medical practice. It should help to distinguish effective screening methods from ineffective ones, and so improve clinical guidelines relating to screening and the prediction and prevention of disease.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which often aggregate results from genome-wide association studies, can bridge the gap between initial discovery efforts and clinical applications for the estimation of disease risk using genetics. However, there is notable heterogeneity in the application and reporting of these risk scores, which hinders the translation of PRSs into clinical care. Here, in a collaboration between the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Complex Disease Working Group and the Polygenic Score (PGS) Catalog, we present the Polygenic Risk Score Reporting Standards (PRS-RS), in which we update the Genetic Risk Prediction Studies (GRIPS) Statement to reflect the present state of the field. Drawing on the input of experts in epidemiology, statistics, disease-specific applications, implementation and policy, this comprehensive reporting framework defines the minimal information that is needed to interpret and evaluate PRSs, especially with respect to downstream clinical applications. Items span detailed descriptions of study populations, statistical methods for the development and validation of PRSs and considerations for the potential limitations of these scores. In addition, we emphasize the need for data availability and transparency, and we encourage researchers to deposit and share PRSs through the PGS Catalog to facilitate reproducibility and comparative benchmarking. By providing these criteria in a structured format that builds on existing standards and ontologies, the use of this framework in publishing PRSs will facilitate translation into clinical care and progress towards defining best practice.},

  abstract = {Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) affects approximately 1 in 250 individuals and is the leading indication for heart transplantation. DCM is often familial, and the most common genetic predisposition is a truncating variation in the giant sarcomeric protein, titin, which occurs in up to 15\% of ambulant patients with DCM and 25\% of end-stage or familial cases. In this article, we review the evidence for the role of titin truncation in the pathogenesis of DCM and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiological consequences of variation in the gene encoding titin (TTN). Such variation is common in the general population (up to 1\% of individuals), and we consider key features that discriminate variants with disease-causing potential from those that are benign. We summarize strategies for clinical interpretation of genetic variants for use in the diagnosis of patients and the evaluation of their relatives. Finally, we consider the contemporary and potential future role for genetic stratification in cardiomyopathy and in the general population, evaluating titin variation as a predictor of outcome and treatment response for precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, with rare pathogenic variants found in about a third of cases (sarcomere-positive). Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrate that common genetic variation contributes substantially to HCM risk. Here, we derive polygenic scores (PGS) from HCM GWAS, and multi-trait analysis of GWAS incorporating genetically-correlated traits, and test their performance in the UK Biobank, 100,000 Genomes Project, and across clinical cohorts. Higher PGS substantially increases population risk of HCM, particularly amongst sarcomere-positive carriers where HCM penetrance differs 10-fold between those in the highest and lowest PGS quintiles. In relatives of HCM patients, PGS stratifies risks of developing HCM and adverse outcomes. Finally, PGS strongly predicts risk of adverse outcomes in HCM, with a 4 to 6-fold increase in death between cases in the highest and lowest PGS quintiles. These findings promise broad clinical utility of PGS in the general population, in cases, and in families with HCM, enabling tailored screening and surveillance, and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes.},

We report a genome-wide association study and multi-trait analysis of DCM (14,256 cases) and three left ventricular traits (36,203 UK Biobank participants). We identified 80 genomic risk loci and prioritized 62 putative effector genes, including several with rare variant DCM associations (MAP3K7, NEDD4L and SSPN). Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, we identify cellular states, biological pathways, and intracellular communications that drive pathogenesis. We demonstrate that polygenic scores predict DCM in the general population and modify penetrance in carriers of rare DCM variants. Our findings may inform the design of genetic testing strategies that incorporate polygenic background. They also provide insights into the molecular etiology of DCM that may facilitate the development of targeted therapeutics.},
