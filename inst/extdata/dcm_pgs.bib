  abstract = {, Over the last decade, great progress has been made in defining the genetic basis of AF. Common variants have been identified at more than 100 genetic loci, and rare mutations have implicated many genes in AF. However, the relative contribution of rare and common genetic variants to AF risk remains unclear. The population-based UK Biobank provides a unique opportunity to assess the genetic contributions to AF risk. In an exome wide analysis, we found that LOF mutations in TTN were strongly associated with AF risk and were highly penetrant. A polygenic risk score of common variants explains a great proportion of AF risk than mutations in TTN. Among TTN mutation carriers, it would be interesting in future work to determine if a subtle cardiomyopathy is present by cardiac imaging or to examine the progression to heart failure or other AF co-morbidities.},

  abstract = {Analyses of data from genome-wide association studies on unrelated individuals have shown that, for human traits and diseases, approximately one-third to two-thirds of heritability is captured by common SNPs. However, it is not known whether the remaining heritability is due to the imperfect tagging of causal variants by common SNPs, in particular whether the causal variants are rare, or whether it is overestimated due to bias in inference from pedigree data. Here we estimated heritability for height and body mass index (BMI) from whole-genome sequence data on 25,465 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. The estimated heritability was 0.68 (standard error 0.10) for height and 0.30 (standard error 0.10) for body mass index. Low minor allele frequency variants in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) with neighboring variants were enriched for heritability, to a greater extent for protein-altering variants, consistent with negative selection. Our results imply that rare variants, in particular those in regions of low linkage disequilibrium, are a major source of the still missing heritability of complex traits and disease.},
