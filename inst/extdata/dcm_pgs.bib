  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To characterize the individual-level agreement of CHD PRSs that perform similarly at the population level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study of participants from diverse backgrounds enrolled in the All of Us Research Program (AOU), Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) ATLAS Precision Health Biobank with electronic health record and genotyping data. EXPOSURES Polygenic risk for CHD from published PRSs and new PRSs developed separately from testing samples. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES PRSs that performed population-level prediction similarly were identified by comparing calibration and discrimination of models of prevalent CHD. Individual-level agreement was tested with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Light {$\kappa$}. RESULTS A total of 48 PRSs were calculated for 171 095 AOU participants. The mean (SD) age was 56.4 (16.8) years. A total of 104 947 participants (61.3\%) were female. A total of 35 590 participants (20.8\%) were most genetically similar to an African reference population, 29 801 (17.4\%) to an admixed American reference population, 100 493 (58.7\%) to a European reference population, and the remaining to Central/South Asian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern reference populations. There were 17 589 participants (10.3\%) with and 153 506 participants without (89.7\%) CHD. When included in a model of prevalent CHD, 46 scores had practically equivalent Brier scores and area under the receiver operator curves (region of practical equivalence {\textpm}0.02). Twenty percent of participants had at least 1 score in both the top and bottom 5\% of risk. Continuous agreement of individual predictions was poor (ICC, 0.373 [95\% CI, 0.372-0.375]). Light {$\kappa$}, used to evaluate consistency of risk assignment, did not exceed 0.56. Analysis among 41 193 PMBB and 53 092 ATLAS participants yielded different sets of equivalent scores, which also lacked individual-level agreement. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE CHD PRSs that performed similarly at the population level demonstrated highly variable individual-level estimates of risk. Recognizing that CHD PRSs may generate incongruent individual-level risk estimates, effective clinical implementation will require refined statistical methods to quantify uncertainty and new strategies to communicate this uncertainty to patients and clinicians.},

  abstract = {, Over the last decade, great progress has been made in defining the genetic basis of AF. Common variants have been identified at more than 100 genetic loci, and rare mutations have implicated many genes in AF. However, the relative contribution of rare and common genetic variants to AF risk remains unclear. The population-based UK Biobank provides a unique opportunity to assess the genetic contributions to AF risk. In an exome wide analysis, we found that LOF mutations in TTN were strongly associated with AF risk and were highly penetrant. A polygenic risk score of common variants explains a great proportion of AF risk than mutations in TTN. Among TTN mutation carriers, it would be interesting in future work to determine if a subtle cardiomyopathy is present by cardiac imaging or to examine the progression to heart failure or other AF co-morbidities.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in the discovery of alleles contributing to the risk of coronary artery disease. In addition to providing causal insights into disease, these endeavours have yielded and enabled the refinement of polygenic risk scores. These scores can be used to predict incident coronary artery disease in multiple cohorts and indicate the clinical response to some preventive therapies in post hoc analyses of clinical trials. These observations and the widespread ability to calculate polygenic risk scores from direct-to-consumer and health-care-associated biobanks have raised many questions about responsible clinical adoption. In this Review, we describe technical and downstream considerations for the derivation and validation of polygenic risk scores and current evidence for their efficacy and safety. We discuss the implementation of these scores in clinical medicine for uses including risk prediction and screening algorithms for coronary artery disease, prioritization of patient subgroups that are likely to derive benefit from treatment, and efficient prospective clinical trial designs.},

  abstract = {Analyses of data from genome-wide association studies on unrelated individuals have shown that, for human traits and diseases, approximately one-third to two-thirds of heritability is captured by common SNPs. However, it is not known whether the remaining heritability is due to the imperfect tagging of causal variants by common SNPs, in particular whether the causal variants are rare, or whether it is overestimated due to bias in inference from pedigree data. Here we estimated heritability for height and body mass index (BMI) from whole-genome sequence data on 25,465 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. The estimated heritability was 0.68 (standard error 0.10) for height and 0.30 (standard error 0.10) for body mass index. Low minor allele frequency variants in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) with neighboring variants were enriched for heritability, to a greater extent for protein-altering variants, consistent with negative selection. Our results imply that rare variants, in particular those in regions of low linkage disequilibrium, are a major source of the still missing heritability of complex traits and disease.},

  abstract = {Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) affects approximately 1 in 250 individuals and is the leading indication for heart transplantation. DCM is often familial, and the most common genetic predisposition is a truncating variation in the giant sarcomeric protein, titin, which occurs in up to 15\% of ambulant patients with DCM and 25\% of end-stage or familial cases. In this article, we review the evidence for the role of titin truncation in the pathogenesis of DCM and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiological consequences of variation in the gene encoding titin (TTN). Such variation is common in the general population (up to 1\% of individuals), and we consider key features that discriminate variants with disease-causing potential from those that are benign. We summarize strategies for clinical interpretation of genetic variants for use in the diagnosis of patients and the evaluation of their relatives. Finally, we consider the contemporary and potential future role for genetic stratification in cardiomyopathy and in the general population, evaluating titin variation as a predictor of outcome and treatment response for precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, with rare pathogenic variants found in about a third of cases (sarcomere-positive). Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrate that common genetic variation contributes substantially to HCM risk. Here, we derive polygenic scores (PGS) from HCM GWAS, and multi-trait analysis of GWAS incorporating genetically-correlated traits, and test their performance in the UK Biobank, 100,000 Genomes Project, and across clinical cohorts. Higher PGS substantially increases population risk of HCM, particularly amongst sarcomere-positive carriers where HCM penetrance differs 10-fold between those in the highest and lowest PGS quintiles. In relatives of HCM patients, PGS stratifies risks of developing HCM and adverse outcomes. Finally, PGS strongly predicts risk of adverse outcomes in HCM, with a 4 to 6-fold increase in death between cases in the highest and lowest PGS quintiles. These findings promise broad clinical utility of PGS in the general population, in cases, and in families with HCM, enabling tailored screening and surveillance, and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes.},
