  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Role of GLP-1 variants on basal GLP-1 levels, body weight and cardiovascular risk factors remains unclear in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the effects of rs6923761 GLP-1 receptor polymorphism on body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, basal GLP-1 levels and serum adipokine levels in na{\"i}ve patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. DESIGN: A sample of 104 na{\"i}ve patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 was enrolled in a prospective way. Basal fasting glucose, c-reactive protein (CRP), insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA), total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides concentration, basal GLP-1, HbA1c and adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin) levels were determined. Weights, body mass index, waist circumference, fat mass by bioimpedance and blood pressure measures were measured. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (47.1\%) had the genotype GG and 55 (52.9\%) diabetic subjects had the next genotypes; GA (44 patients, 42.3\%) or AA (11 study subjects, 10.6\%) (second group). In A allele carriers, basal GLP-1 levels were higher than non-carriers (2.9 {$\pm$} 2.1 ng/ml; p {$<$} 0.05). No differences were detected between both genotype groups. CONCLUSION: Our cross-sectional study revealed an association between the rs6923761 GLP-1 receptor polymorphism (A allele carriers) and basal GLP-1 levels in na{\"i}ve patients with diabetes mellitus type 2.},

The impact of genetic variability of GLP1R on receptor function and its association with metabolic traits are unclear with conflicting reports. Here, we show an unexpected diversity of phenotypes ranging from defective cell surface expression to complete or pathway-specific gain of function (GoF) and loss of function (LoF), after performing a functional profiling of 60 GLP1R variants across four signalling pathways. The defective insulin secretion of GLP1R LoF variants is rescued by allosteric GLP1R ligands or high concentrations of exendin-4/semaglutide in INS-1 823/3 cells. Genetic association studies in 200,000 participants from the UK Biobank show that impaired GLP1R cell surface expression contributes to poor glucose control and increased adiposity with increased glycated haemoglobin A1c and body mass index. This study defines impaired GLP1R cell surface expression as a risk factor for traits associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity and provides potential treatment options for GLP1R LoF variant carriers.},

The emergence of GIP receptor (GIPR){\textendash}GLP1 receptor (GLP1R) co-agonists has fostered growing interest in the actions of GIP and GLP1 in metabolically relevant tissues. Here, we update concepts of how these hormones act beyond the pancreas. The actions of GIP and GLP1 on liver, muscle and adipose tissue, in the control of glucose and lipid homeostasis, are discussed in the context of plausible mechanisms of action. Both the GIPR and GLP1R are expressed in the central nervous system, wherein receptor activation produces anorectic effects enabling weight loss. In preclinical studies, GIP and GLP1 reduce atherosclerosis. Furthermore, GIPR and GLP1R are expressed within the heart and immune system, and GLP1R within the kidney, revealing putative mechanisms linking GIP and GLP1R agonism to cardiorenal protection. We interpret the clinical and mechanistic data obtained for different agents that enable weight loss and glucose control for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively, by activating or blocking GIPR signalling, including the GIPR{\textendash}GLP1R co-agonist tirzepatide, as well as the GIPR antagonist{\textendash}GLP1R~agonist AMG-133. Collectively, we update translational concepts of GIP and GLP1 action, while highlighting gaps, areas of uncertainty and controversies meriting ongoing investigation.},

  abstract = {Introduction Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) agonists are highly effective agents for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). GLP-1 is also implicated in outcomes of bariatric surgery, including appetite changes and T2D remission. Rare, potentially deleterious mutations in the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor gene (GLP1R) may, therefore, have important implications for pathogenesis of obesity and T2D, and for response to therapeutic interventions. Methods A custom Axion genotyping array, including 117 rare predicted-deleterious GLP1R mutations (MAF{$<$}0.01 in gnomAD, CADD-PHRED m {$>$}= 15), was used to screen 1714 unrelated adults with BMI {$>$}35 kg/m2 from the PMMO study. We also examined the UK Biobank (UKB) exome sequence dataset for rare, predicted-deleterious GLP1R variants and tested their effects on weight and glycaemia-related traits. Results Thirty-four PMMO participants carried one of the 117 GLP1R variants screened (11 might have been expected using the sum of their gnomAD control MAFs). These 8 variants were associated with T2D in the UKB and subsequent gene-level analysis of the UKB exome sequence dataset (629/39,274 carriers) confirmed that rare GLP1R variants are associated with increased risk of T2D (OR=1.58), as well as with higher HbA1c levels (p= 0.039). Furthermore, our data highlight a potential interaction of these variants with body mass index. Conclusion Rare, potentially deleterious GLP1R mutations is associated with increased T2D risk, as well as higher HbA1c in UKB participants without diabetes. Future studies should examine the implications of GLP1R mutations for response to GLP1 agonist treatment and explore the observed interactions with obesity in T2D risk, including in larger cohorts with obesity.},

  abstract = {Conventional measurements of fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels investigated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) cannot capture the effects of DNA variability on `around the clock' glucoregulatory processes. Here we show that GWAS meta-analysis of glucose measurements under nonstandardized conditions (random glucose (RG)) in 476,326 individuals of diverse ancestries and without diabetes enables locus discovery and innovative pathophysiological observations. We discovered 120 RG loci represented by 150 distinct signals, including 13 with sex-dimorphic effects, two cross-ancestry and seven rare frequency signals. Of these, 44 loci are new for glycemic traits. Regulatory, glycosylation and metagenomic annotations highlight ileum and colon tissues, indicating an underappreciated role of the gastrointestinal tract in controlling blood glucose. Functional follow-up and molecular dynamics simulations of lower frequency coding variants in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R), a type 2 diabetes treatment target, reveal that optimal selection of GLP-1R agonist therapy will benefit from tailored genetic stratification. We also provide evidence from Mendelian randomization that lung function is modulated by blood glucose and that pulmonary dysfunction is a diabetes complication. Our investigation yields new insights into the biology of glucose regulation, diabetes complications and pathways for treatment stratification.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Lost glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) function affects human physiology. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to identify coding nonsynonymous GLP1R variants in Danish individuals to link their in vitro phenotypes and clinical phenotypic associations. METHODS: We sequenced GLP1R in 8642 Danish individuals with type 2 diabetes or normal glucose tolerance and examined the ability of nonsynonymous variants to bind GLP-1 and to signal in transfected cells via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation and {$\beta$}-arrestin recruitment. We performed a cross-sectional study between the burden of loss-of-signaling (LoS) variants and cardiometabolic phenotypes in 2930 patients with type 2 diabetes and 5712 participants in a population-based cohort. Furthermore, we studied the association between cardiometabolic phenotypes and the burden of the LoS variants and 60 partly overlapping predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) GLP1R variants found in 330 566 unrelated White exome-sequenced participants in the UK Biobank cohort. RESULTS: We identified 36 nonsynonymous variants in GLP1R, of which 10 had a statistically significant loss in GLP-1-induced cAMP signaling compared to wild-type. However, no association was observed between the LoS variants and type 2 diabetes, although LoS variant carriers had a minor increased fasting plasma glucose level. Moreover, pLoF variants from the UK Biobank also did not reveal substantial cardiometabolic associations, despite a small effect on glycated hemoglobin A1c. CONCLUSION: Since no homozygous LoS nor pLoF variants were identified and heterozygous carriers had similar cardiometabolic phenotype as noncarriers, we conclude that GLP-1R may be of particular importance in human physiology, due to a potential evolutionary intolerance of harmful homozygous GLP1R variants.},

So far, many factors leading to the development of this disorder have been identified, including genetic susceptibility. Various studies linked GLP1R variants with anthropometric and metabolic parameters, suggesting the role of the variation in this gene in metabolic health. Objective The aim of this study is to investigate the association of two single nucleotide variants of GLP1R gene, rs2268641 and rs6923761, with excessive weight, metabolic syndrome, anthropometric measurements and selected metabolic parameters. Methods Normal-weight subjects (n= 340, control group) and subjects with excessive body mass (n = 600, study group) participated in this study. For all participants, anthropometric measurements and metabolic parameters were collected, and genotyping of the two single nucleotide variants of GLP1R gene, rs2268641 and rs6923761, was performed using the high-resolution melting curve analysis. Results Significant differences in the genotype distribution of rs2268641 were found, where homozygous TT genotype was significantly less frequent in the study group with excessive body mass (OR=0.66; p=0.0298). For rs6923761, A allele and homozygous AA genotype were significantly more frequent in the study group with excessive weight than in the control group (OR=1.27; p=0.0239 and OR=1.69; p=0.0205, respectively). The association of studied variants with metabolic parameters was found for rs6923761. For this variant, AA carriers had higher body mass in comparison to GG carriers (p=0.0246), and AA carriers had higher glucose concentration in comparison to AG carriers (p=0.0498). We did not find an association of rs2268641 and rs6923761 with metabolic syndrome. Conclusion In our study, AA carriers of rs6923761 had higher risk of excessive body mass, whereas TT carriers of rs2268641 had lower risk of being overweight. Moreover, homozygous carriers of the minor allele of rs6923761 had higher glucose concentration in comparison to heterozygous subjects. None of the studied variants were associated with metabolic syndrome in the studied population.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity at genomic loci encoding drug targets can be exploited by multivariable Mendelian randomization to provide insight on the pathways by which pharmacological interventions may affect disease risk. However, statistical inference in such investigations may be poor if overdispersion heterogeneity in measured genetic associations is unaccounted for. In this work, we first develop conditional F-statistics for dimension-reduced genetic associations that enable more accurate measurement of phenotypic heterogeneity. We then develop a novel extension for two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization that accounts for overdispersion heterogeneity in dimension-reduced genetic associations. Our empirical focus is to use genetic variants in the GLP1R gene region to understand the mechanism by which GLP1R agonism affects coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Colocalization analyses indicate that distinct variants in the GLP1R gene region are associated with body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses that were corrected for overdispersion heterogeneity suggest that bodyweight lowering rather than type 2 diabetes liability lowering effects of GLP1R agonism are more likely contributing to reduced CAD risk. Tissue-specific analyses prioritised brain tissue as the most likely to be relevant for CAD risk, of the tissues considered. We hope the multivariable Mendelian randomization approach illustrated here is widely applicable to better understand mechanisms linking drug targets to diseases outcomes, and hence to guide drug development efforts.},

Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs, indicating their potential involvement in regulation of gene expression. Here, we propose a transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously. Applied to 43 human phenotypes, it uncovers 3,913 putatively causal gene{\textendash}trait associations, 36\% of which have no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS. Using independent association summary statistics, we find that the majority of these loci were missed by GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a Mendelian form of encephalopathy. We also find pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections. TWMR better accounts for pleiotropy and has the potential to identify biological mechanisms underlying complex traits.},

Here we report how the `no horizontal pleiotropy assumption' is strengthened when proteins are the risk factors of interest. Proteins are typically the proximal effectors of biological processes encoded in the genome. Moreover, proteins are the targets of most medicines, so MR studies of drug targets are becoming a fundamental tool in drug development. To enable such studies, we introduce a mathematical framework that contrasts MR analysis of proteins with that of risk factors located more distally in the causal chain from gene to disease. We illustrate key model decisions and introduce an analytical framework for maximising power and evaluating the robustness of analyses.},

  abstract = {Objective Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce serum urate, but their efficacy depends on renal function which is often impaired in people with gout. SGLT1 is primarily expressed in the small intestine and its inhibition may be a more suitable therapeutic target. We aimed to investigate the association of genetically proxied SGLT1i with gout risk, serum urate levels and cardiovascular safety using Mendelian randomisation (MR). Methods Leveraging data from a genome-wide association study of 344,182 individuals in the UK Biobank, we identified a missense variant in the SLC5A1 gene that associated with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) to proxy SGLT1i. Outcome genetic data comprised 13,179 gout cases and 750,634 controls, 457,690 individuals for serum urate levels, and up to 977,323 individuals for cardiovascular safety outcomes. We applied the Wald ratio method and investigated potential genetic confounding using colocalization. Results The rs17683430 missense variant was selected to instrument SGLT1i. Genetically proxied SGLT1i was associated with 75\% reduction in gout risk (OR 0.25; 95\%CI 0.06, 0.99; p~=~0.048) and 32.0~{$\mu$}mol/L reduction in serum urate (95\%CI -56.7, -7.3; p~=~0.01), per 6.7~mmol/mol reduction in HbA1c. SGLT1i was associated with increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.37~mmol/L; 95\%CI 0.17, 0.56; p~=~0.0002) but not risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, or chronic kidney disease. Colocalization did not suggest that results are attributable to genetic confounding. Conclusion SGLT1 inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic option for preventing gout in people with or without comorbid diabetes. Randomised trials are needed to formally investigate efficacy and safety.},
