  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature regarding the familial heritability of heart failure and to discuss the possible mechanisms through which this risk is mediated. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from the Framingham Heart Study recently showed that the parental occurrence of heart failure increases the risk of heart failure in offspring. Although the mechanisms mediating this increased risk are not elucidated, heritable risks of heart failure may result from genes affecting the cardiac or vascular systems. Alternatively, familial risk may be mediated partly through the inheritance of recognized or as yet unidentified risk factors for heart failure. Heritable components or genetic loci for quantitative traits contribute to the development of hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, valvular heart disease, and metabolic conditions, which collectively increase the risk of heart failure. SUMMARY: A careful assessment of the family history of heart failure and associated risk factors may identify treatable targets that can potentially reduce the likelihood of developing heart failure, and can assist in the implementation of preventive strategies for risk populations with stages A and B heart failure.},

To gain insight into their underlying molecular mechanisms, we have created the translational human pancreatic islet genotype tissue-expression resource (TIGER), aggregating {$>$}500 human islet genomic datasets from five cohorts in the Horizon 2020 consortium T2DSystems. We impute genotypes using four reference panels and meta-analyze cohorts to improve the coverage of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and develop a method to combine allele-specific expression across samples (cASE). We identify {$>$}1 million islet eQTLs, 53 of which colocalize with T2D signals. Among them, a low-frequency allele that reduces T2D risk by half increases \emph{CCND2} expression. We identify eight cASE colocalizations, among which we found a T2D-associated \emph{SLC30A8} variant. We make all data available through the TIGER portal (http://tiger.bsc.es), which represents a comprehensive human islet genomic data resource to elucidate how genetic variation affects islet function and translates into therapeutic insight and precision medicine for T2D.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ultrafiltration is an alternative strategy to diuretic therapy for the treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Little is known about the efficacy and safety of ultrafiltration in patients with acute decompensated heart failure complicated by persistent congestion and worsened renal function. METHODS: We randomly assigned a total of 188 patients with acute decompensated heart failure, worsened renal function, and persistent congestion to a strategy of stepped pharmacologic therapy (94 patients) or ultrafiltration (94 patients). The primary end point was the bivariate change from baseline in the serum creatinine level and body weight, as assessed 96 hours after random assignment. Patients were followed for 60 days. RESULTS: Ultrafiltration was inferior to pharmacologic therapy with respect to the bivariate end point of the change in the serum creatinine level and body weight 96 hours after enrollment (P=0.003), owing primarily to an increase in the creatinine level in the ultrafiltration group. At 96 hours, the mean change in the creatinine level was -0.04{\textpm}0.53 mg per deciliter (-3.5{\textpm}46.9 {$\mu$}mol per liter) in the pharmacologic-therapy group, as compared with +0.23{\textpm}0.70 mg per deciliter (20.3{\textpm}61.9 {$\mu$}mol per liter) in the ultrafiltration group (P=0.003). There was no significant difference in weight loss 96 hours after enrollment between patients in the pharmacologic-therapy group and those in the ultrafiltration group (a loss of 5.5{\textpm}5.1 kg [12.1{\textpm}11.3 lb] and 5.7{\textpm}3.9 kg [12.6{\textpm}8.5 lb], respectively; P=0.58). A higher percentage of patients in the ultrafiltration group than in the pharmacologic-therapy group had a serious adverse event (72\% vs. 57\%, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial involving patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure, worsened renal function, and persistent congestion, the use of a stepped pharmacologic-therapy algorithm was superior to a strategy of ultrafiltration for the preservation of renal function at 96 hours, with a similar amount of weight loss with the two approaches. Ultrafiltration was associated with a higher rate of adverse events. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00608491.).},

  abstract = {Background Ticagrelor reduces ischemic risk in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI). It remains unclear whether ischemic risk and the benefits of prolonged P2Y12 inhibition in this population remain consistent over time. Objectives The study sought to investigate the pattern of ischemic risk over time and whether the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor were similar early and late after randomization. Methods The PEGASUS-TIMI (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin--Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) 54 trial randomized patients with prior MI (median 1.7 years prior) to ticagrelor 90 mg, ticagrelor 60 mg, or placebo on a background of aspirin. The rates of cardiovascular (CV) death, MI, and stroke as well as TIMI major bleeding were analyzed at yearly landmarks (years 1, 2, and 3). Results A total of 21,162 patients were randomized and followed for 33 months (median), with 28\% of patients {$\geq$}5 years from MI at trial conclusion. The risk of CV death, MI, or stroke in the placebo arm remained roughly constant over the trial at an {$\sim$}3\% annualized rate. The benefit of ticagrelor 60 mg was consistent at each subsequent landmark (year 1 hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.99; year 2 HR: 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.74 to 1.11; and year 3 HR: 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.62 to 1.00). TIMI major bleeding was increased with ticagrelor 60 mg at each landmark, but with the greatest hazard in the first year (year 1 HR: 3.22; year 2 HR: 2.07; year 3 HR: 1.65). Conclusions Patients with a history of MI remain at persistent high risk for CVD, MI, and stroke as late as 5 years after MI. The efficacy of low-dose ticagrelor is consistent over time with a trend toward less excess bleeding.

Objective: To determine the effect of 4 weeks' administration of inhaled, nebulized inorganic nitrite on exercise capacity in HFpEF. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment, crossover trial of 105 patients with HFpEF. Participants were enrolled from July 22, 2016, to September 12, 2017, at 17 US sites, with final date of follow-up of January 2, 2018. Interventions: Inorganic nitrite or placebo administered via micronebulizer device. During each 6-week phase of the crossover study, participants received no study drug for 2 weeks (baseline/washout) followed by study drug (nitrite or placebo) at 46 mg 3 times a day for 1 week followed by 80 mg 3 times a day for 3 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min). Secondary end points included daily activity levels assessed by accelerometry, health status as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (score range, 0-100, with higher scores reflecting better quality of life), functional class, cardiac filling pressures assessed by echocardiography, N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels, other exercise indices, adverse events, and tolerability. Outcomes were assessed after treatment for 4 weeks. Results: Among 105 patients who were randomized (median age, 68 years; 56\% women), 98 (93\%) completed the trial. During the nitrite phase, there was no significant difference in mean peak oxygen consumption as compared with the placebo phase (13.5 vs 13.7 mL/kg/min; difference, -0.20 [95\% CI, -0.56 to 0.16]; P =.27).

Here, we analyzed 2,344 subcutaneous adipose tissue samples and identified 34K conditionally distinct expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) signals in 18K genes. Over half of eQTL genes exhibited at least two eQTL signals. Compared to primary signals, non-primary signals had lower effect sizes, lower minor allele frequencies, and less promoter enrichment; they corresponded to genes with higher heritability and higher tolerance for loss of function. Colocalization of eQTL with conditionally distinct genome-wide association study signals for 28 cardiometabolic traits identified 3,605 eQTL signals for 1,861 genes. Inclusion of non-primary eQTL signals increased colocalized signals by 46\%. Among 30 genes with {$\geq$}2 pairs of colocalized signals, 21 showed a mediating gene dosage effect on the trait.

  abstract = {Complete characterization of the genetic effects on gene expression is needed to elucidate tissue biology and the etiology of complex traits. Here, we analyzed 2,344 subcutaneous adipose tissue samples and identified 34K conditionally distinct expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) signals in 18K genes. Over half of eQTL genes exhibited at least two eQTL signals. Compared to primary signals, non-primary signals had lower effect sizes, lower minor allele frequencies, and less promoter enrichment; they corresponded to genes with higher heritability and higher tolerance for loss of function. Colocalization of eQTL with conditionally distinct genome-wide association study signals for 28 cardiometabolic traits identified 3,605 eQTL signals for 1,861 genes. Inclusion of non-primary eQTL signals increased colocalized signals by 46\%. Among 30 genes with {$\geq$}2 pairs of colocalized signals, 21 showed a mediating gene dosage effect on the trait. Thus, expanded eQTL identification reveals more mechanisms underlying complex traits and improves understanding of the complexity of gene expression regulation.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Persistent congestion is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (AHF). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists administered at high doses may relieve congestion, overcome diuretic resistance, and mitigate the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation in AHF. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of high-dose spironolactone and usual care on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels compared with usual care alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind and placebo (or low-dose)-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 22 US acute care hospitals among patients with AHF who were previously receiving no or low-dose (12.5 mg or 25 mg daily) spironolactone and had NT-proBNP levels of 1000 pg/mL or more or B-type natriuretic peptide levels of 250 pg/mL or more, regardless of ejection fraction. INTERVENTIONS: High-dose spironolactone (100 mg) vs placebo or 25 mg spironolactone (usual care) daily for 96 hours MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the change in NT-proBNP levels from baseline to 96 hours. Secondary end points included the clinical congestion score, dyspnea assessment, net urine output, and net weight change. Safety end points included hyperkalemia and changes in renal function. RESULTS: A total of 360 patients were randomized, of whom the median age was 65 years, 129 (36\%) were women, 200 (55.5\%) were white, 151 (42\%) were black, 8 (2\%) were Hispanic or Latino, 9 (2.5\%) were of other race/ethnicity, and the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 34\%. Baseline median (interquartile range) NT-proBNP levels were 4601 (2697-9596) pg/mL among the group treated with high-dose spironolactone and 3753 (1968-7633) pg/mL among the group who received usual care. There was no significant difference in the log NT-proBNP reduction between the 2 groups (-0.55 [95\% CI, -0.92 to -0.18] with high-dose spironolactone and -0.49 [95\% CI, -0.98 to -0.14] with usual care, P = .57). None of the secondary end point or day-30 all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization rate differed between the 2 groups. The changes in serum potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adding treatment with high-dose spironolactone to usual care for patients with AHF for 96 hours was well tolerated but did not improve the primary or secondary efficacy end points.

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have provided many genetic markers that can be used as instrumental variables to adjust for confounding in epidemiological studies. Recently, the principle has been applied to other forms of bias in observational studies, especially collider bias that arises when conditioning or stratifying on a variable that is associated with the outcome of interest. An important case is in studies of disease progression and survival. Here, we clarify the links between the genetic instrumental variable methods proposed for this problem and the established methods of Mendelian randomisation developed to account for confounding. We highlight the critical importance of weak instrument bias in this context and describe a corrected weighted least-squares procedure as a simple approach to reduce this bias. We illustrate the range of available methods on two data examples. The first, waist-hip ratio adjusted for body-mass index, entails statistical adjustment for a quantitative trait. The second, smoking cessation, is a stratified analysis conditional on having initiated smoking. In both cases, we find little effect of collider bias on the primary association results, but this may propagate into more substantial effects on further analyses such as polygenic risk scoring and Mendelian randomisation.},

Two recent independent cardiovascular SNP array studies identified a common SNP at 1p36 in intron 2 of the HSPB7 gene as being associated with heart failure. HSPB7 resequencing identified other risk alleles but no functional gene variants. Here, we further show no effect of the HSPB7 SNP on cardiac HSPB7 mRNA levels or splicing, suggesting that the SNP marks the position of a functional variant in another gene. Accordingly, we used massively parallel platforms to resequence all coding exons of the adjacent CLCNKA gene, which encodes the K(a) renal chloride channel (ClC-K(a)). Of 51 exonic CLCNKA variants identified, one SNP (rs10927887, encoding Arg83Gly) was common, in linkage disequilibrium with the heart failure risk SNP in HSPB7, and associated with heart failure in two independent Caucasian referral populations (n = 2,606 and 1,168; combined P = 2.25 {\texttimes} 10(-6)). Individual genotyping of rs10927887 in the two study populations and a third independent heart failure cohort (combined n = 5,489) revealed an additive allele effect on heart failure risk that is independent of age, sex, and prior hypertension (odds ratio = 1.27 per allele copy; P = 8.3 {\texttimes} 10(-7)). Functional characterization of recombinant wild-type Arg83 and variant Gly83 ClC-K(a) chloride channel currents revealed {$\approx$} 50\% loss-of-function of the variant channel. These findings identify a common, functionally significant genetic risk factor for Caucasian heart failure. The variant CLCNKA risk allele, telegraphed by linked variants in the adjacent HSPB7 gene, uncovers a previously overlooked genetic mechanism affecting the cardio-renal axis.},

  abstract = {PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format.To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, (n)-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0).The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.},

The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether specific genetic variants in GLP1R or TCF7L2 are associated with delayed GE and weight loss in obese patients treated with liraglutide or the short-acting GLP-1 agonist, exenatide. METHODS: We evaluated in obese individuals the associations of genetic variations of GLP1R (rs6923761) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146) on GE T1/2 and weight from two trials that evaluated separately exenatide, 5~{$\mu$}g BID for 30~days, or liraglutide, 3~mg daily for 5~weeks. Data were analyzed using the dominant genetic model and intention-to-treat analysis. KEY RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between changes in weight and GE T1/2 (rs ~=~-.382, P~=~.004). GLP1R rs6923761 minor allele A (AA\_AG) carriers who received either exenatide or liraglutide had greater delay in GE T1/2 relative to baseline (117.9~{\textpm}~27.5 [SEM] minutes and 128.9~{\textpm}~38.32~minutes) compared to GG genotype (95.8~{\textpm}~30.4~minutes and 61.4~{\textpm}~21.4~minutes, respectively; P~=~.11). There was a non-significant difference in weight loss based on GLP1R rs6923761 genotype after 5~weeks of treatment. There were no significant correlations with TCF7L2 (rs7903146) genotype. CONCLUSIONS \& INFERENCES: The minor A allele of GLP1R (rs6923761) is associated with greater delay in GE T1/2 in response to liraglutide and exenatide. These studies provide data to plan pharmacogenetics testing of the hypothesis that GLP1R (rs6923761) influences weight loss in response to GLP1R agonists.},

OBJECTIVE: To test the 2 independent hypotheses that, compared with placebo, addition of low-dose dopamine (2 {$\mu$}g/kg/min) or low-dose nesiritide (0.005 {$\mu$}g/kg/min without bolus) to diuretic therapy will enhance decongestion and preserve renal function in patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation [ROSE]) of 360 hospitalized patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15-60 mL/min/1.73m2), randomized within 24 hours of admission. Enrollment occurred from September 2010 to March 2013 across 26 sites in North America. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized in an open, 1:1 allocation ratio to the dopamine or nesiritide strategy. Within each strategy, participants were randomized in a double-blind, 2:1 ratio to active treatment or placebo. The dopamine (n = 122) and nesiritide (n = 119) groups were independently compared with the pooled placebo group (n = 119).

RESULTS: Compared with placebo, low-dose dopamine had no significant effect on 72-hour cumulative urine volume (dopamine, 8524 mL; 95\%CI, 7917-9131 vs placebo, 8296 mL; 95\% CI, 7762-8830 ; difference, 229 mL; 95\%CI, -714 to 1171 mL; P = .59) or on the change in cystatin C level (dopamine, 0.12mg/L; 95\%CI, 0.06-0.18 vs placebo, 0.11mg/L; 95\%CI, 0.06-0.16; difference, 0.01; 95\%CI, -0.08 to 0.10; P = .72). Similarly, low-dose nesiritide had no significant effect on 72-hour cumulative urine volume (nesiritide, 8574 mL; 95\%CI, 8014-9134 vs placebo, 8296 mL; 95\%CI, 7762-8830; difference, 279 mL; 95\%CI, -618 to 1176 mL; P = .49) or on the change in cystatin C level (nesiritide, 0.07mg/L; 95\%CI, 0.01-0.13 vs placebo, 0.11mg/L; 95\%CI, 0.06-0.16; difference, -0.04; 95\%CI, -0.13 to 0.05; P = .36). Compared with placebo, there was no effect of low-dose dopamine or nesiritide on secondary end points reflective of decongestion, renal function, or clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In participants with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction, neither low-dose dopamine nor low-dose nesiritide enhanced decongestion or improved renal function when added to diuretic therapy.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. We therefore evaluated the long-term effects of the addition of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure. METHODS: A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours. RESULTS: Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure; 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P{$<$}0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life as compared with placebo (P{$<$}0.01). In a post hoc analysis of the combined end point and mortality in subgroups defined according to base-line treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients receiving neither or one of these types of drugs but an adverse effect in patients receiving both types of drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Valsartan significantly reduces the combined end point of mortality and morbidity and improves clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, when added to prescribed therapy. However, the post hoc observation of an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta-blocker raises concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.},

  abstract = {Background This study was designed to investigate the genetic evidence for repurposing of GLP1R (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor) agonists to prevent heart failure (HF) and whether the potential benefit exceeds the benefit conferred by more general glycemic control. Methods and Results We applied 2-sample Mendelian randomization of genetically proxied GLP1R agonism on HF as the main outcome and left ventricular ejection fraction as the secondary outcome. The associations were compared with those of general glycemic control on the same outcomes. Genetic associations were obtained from genome-wide association study summary statistics of type 2 diabetes mellitus (228~499 cases and 1~178~783 controls), glycated hemoglobin (n=344~182), HF (47,309 cases and 930~014 controls), and left ventricular ejection fraction (n=16~923). Genetic proxies for GLP1R agonism associated with reduced risk of HF (odds ratio per 1~mmol/mol decrease in glycated hemoglobin 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.64--0.87; P=1.69{\texttimes}10-4), and higher left ventricular ejection fraction (SD change in left ventricular ejection fraction per 1~mmol/mol decrease in glycated hemoglobin 0.22\%; 95\% CI, 0.03--0.42; P=0.03). The magnitude of these benefits exceeded those expected from improved glycemic control more generally. The results were similar in sensitivity analyses, and we did not find evidence to suggest that these associations were mediated by reduced coronary artery disease risk. Conclusions This genetic evidence supports the repurposing of GLP1R agonists for preventing HF.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a case-control study to further investigate the potential impact of 14 previously reported candidate genes on the risk of HF and specific HF sub-types. We also performed an exploratory genome-wide study. We included 799 patients with HF and 1529 controls. After adjusting for age, sex, and genetic ancestry, we found that the C allele of rs2234962 in BAG3 was associated with a decreased risk of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (odds ratio 0.42, 95\% confidence interval 0.25-0.68, P~=~0.0005), consistent with a previous report. No association for the other primary variants or exploratory genome-wide study was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide independent replication for the association between a common coding variant (rs2234962) in BAG3 and the risk of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.},

We prioritized 186 cis-eQTLs for 31 brain-related traits using Mendelian randomization and co-localization including 40 cis-eQTLs with an inferred cell type, such as a neuron-specific cis-eQTL (CYP24A1) for multiple sclerosis. We further describe 737 trans-eQTLs for 526 unique variants and 108 unique genes. We used brain-specific gene-co-regulation networks to link GWAS loci and prioritize additional genes for five central nervous system diseases. This study represents a valuable resource for post-GWAS research on central nervous system diseases.},

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the effects of rs6923761 GLP-1 receptor polymorphism on body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, basal GLP-1 levels and serum adipokine levels in na{\"i}ve patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. DESIGN: A sample of 104 na{\"i}ve patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 was enrolled in a prospective way. Basal fasting glucose, c-reactive protein (CRP), insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA), total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides concentration, basal GLP-1, HbA1c and adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin) levels were determined. Weights, body mass index, waist circumference, fat mass by bioimpedance and blood pressure measures were measured. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (47.1\%) had the genotype GG and 55 (52.9\%) diabetic subjects had the next genotypes; GA (44 patients, 42.3\%) or AA (11 study subjects, 10.6\%) (second group). In A allele carriers, basal GLP-1 levels were higher than non-carriers (2.9 {\textpm} 2.1 ng/ml; p {$<$} 0.05). No differences were detected between both genotype groups. CONCLUSION: Our cross-sectional study revealed an association between the rs6923761 GLP-1 receptor polymorphism (A allele carriers) and basal GLP-1 levels in na{\"i}ve patients with diabetes mellitus type 2.},

  abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a well-studied incretin hormone receptor and target of several therapeutic drugs for type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity and, more recently, cardiovascular disease. Some signalling pathways downstream of GLP-1R may be responsible for drug adverse effects such as nausea, while others mediate therapeutic outcomes of incretin-based T2D therapeutics. Understanding the interplay between different factors that alter signalling, trafficking, and receptor activity, including biased agonism, single nucleotide polymorphisms and structural modifications is key to develop the next-generation of personalised GLP-1R agonists. However, these interactions remain poorly described, especially for novel therapeutics such as dual and tri-agonists that target more than one incretin receptor. Comparison of GLP-1R structures in complex with G proteins and different peptide and non-peptide agonists has revealed novel insights into important agonist-residue interactions and networks crucial for receptor activation, recruitment of G proteins and engagement of specific signalling pathways. Here, we review the latest knowledge on GLP-1R structure and activation, providing structural evidence for biased agonism and delineating important networks associated with this phenomenon. We survey current biased agonists and multi-agonists at different stages of development, highlighting possible challenges in their translational potential. Lastly, we discuss findings related to non-synonymous genomic variants of GLP1R and the functional importance of specific residues involved in GLP-1R function. We propose that studies of GLP-1R polymorphisms, and specifically their effect on receptor dynamics and pharmacology in response to biased agonists, could have a significant impact in delineating precision medicine approaches and development of novel therapeutics.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure with a strong familial component. We performed an exome-wide array-based association study (EWAS) to assess the contribution of missense variants to sporadic DCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: 116,855 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were analyzed in 2796 DCM patients and 6877 control subjects from 6 populations of European ancestry. We confirmed two previously identified associations with SNVs in BAG3 and ZBTB17 and discovered six novel DCM-associated loci (Q-value{$<$}0.01). The lead-SNVs at novel loci are common and located in TTN, SLC39A8, MLIP, FLNC, ALPK3 and FHOD3. In silico fine mapping identified HSPB7 as the most likely candidate at the ZBTB17 locus. Rare variant analysis (MAF{$<$}0.01) demonstrated significant association for TTN variants only (P = 0.0085). All candidate genes but one (SLC39A8) exhibit preferential expression in striated muscle tissues and mutations in TTN, BAG3, FLNC and FHOD3 are known to cause familial cardiomyopathy. We also investigated a panel of 48 known cardiomyopathy genes. Collectively, rare (n = 228, P = 0.0033) or common (n = 36, P = 0.019) variants with elevated in silico severity scores were associated with DCM, indicating that the spectrum of genes contributing to sporadic DCM extends beyond those identified here. CONCLUSION: We identified eight loci independently associated with sporadic DCM. The functions of the best candidate genes at these loci suggest that proteostasis regulation might play a role in DCM pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical practice varies widely in the dosing and administration of loop diuretics for patients hospitalized with heart failure. Current guidelines are based primarily on expert opinion, although several small studies have suggested that continuous infusion is more effective than bolus administration in promoting diuresis and reducing the likelihood of renal dysfunction. Felker and colleagues conducted the Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation trial to evaluate various diuretic strategies for acute decompensated heart failure. The Study: The trial prospectively examined diuretic doses and administration modes in 308 patients requiring hospitalization for acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, despite having been on an oral loop diuretic for at least one month. Patients were excluded if they required intravenous vasodilators or inotropic agents other than digoxin, had hypotension, or had a serum creatinine level greater than 3.0 mg per dL (265.2 {$\mu$}mol per L). Patients were randomized to receive intravenous furosemide, which varied along two interventions: (1) low versus high dose (total daily dose either equivalent to or 2.5 times greater than the patient's previous daily loop diuretic dose, respectively); (2) and method of administration (continuous infusion versus boluses every 12 hours). The interventions were continued for up to 72 hours, with the treating physician having the option at 48 hours to adjust treatment if clinically warranted. Patients were monitored for 60 days after admission. The primary study outcomes included patients' global assessment of their symptoms, and changes in serum creatinine levels over the first 72 hours. Results: Regardless of intervention, no differences were seen between the groups with regard to median hospital length of stay, 60-day mortality, rehospitalization, or emergency department visits. Similarly, there were no differences in patients' reported symptoms or in mean changes in creatinine level. Patients receiving high-dose furosemide were more likely to be changed to oral diuretics at 48 hours than those assigned to the low-dose strategy (31 versus 17 percent; P {\textexclamdown}.001). They also had greater levels of fluid loss. High-dose furosemide was associated with a greater likelihood of a transient increase in serum creatinine of more than 0.3 mg per dL (26.52 {$\mu$}mol per L) during the initial 72 hours of treatment (23 versus 14 percent in the low-dose group; P =.04), which had resolved by day 60. Conclusion: In patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours when intravenous loop diuretics were given via bolus versus continuous infusion, or with a low-dose versus high-dose strategy. {\copyright} 2012 American Academy of Family Physicians.},

The impact of genetic variability of GLP1R on receptor function and its association with metabolic traits are unclear with conflicting reports. Here, we show an unexpected diversity of phenotypes ranging from defective cell surface expression to complete or pathway-specific gain of function (GoF) and loss of function (LoF), after performing a functional profiling of 60 GLP1R variants across four signalling pathways. The defective insulin secretion of GLP1R LoF variants is rescued by allosteric GLP1R ligands or high concentrations of exendin-4/semaglutide in INS-1 823/3 cells. Genetic association studies in 200,000 participants from the UK Biobank show that impaired GLP1R cell surface expression contributes to poor glucose control and increased adiposity with increased glycated haemoglobin A1c and body mass index. This study defines impaired GLP1R cell surface expression as a risk factor for traits associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity and provides potential treatment options for GLP1R LoF variant carriers.},

We identified and replicated two new DCM-associated loci on chromosome 3p25.1 [lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs62232870, P\,=\,8.7 {\texttimes} 10-11 and 7.7 {\texttimes} 10-4 in the discovery and replication steps, respectively] and chromosome 22q11.23 (lead SNP rs7284877, P\,=\,3.3 {\texttimes} 10-8 and 1.4 {\texttimes} 10-3 in the discovery and replication steps, respectively), while confirming two previously identified DCM loci on chromosomes 10 and 1, BAG3 and HSPB7. A genetic risk score constructed from the number of risk alleles at these four DCM loci revealed a 3-fold increased risk of DCM for individuals with 8 risk alleles compared to individuals with 5 risk alleles (median of the referral population). In silico annotation and functional 4C-sequencing analyses on iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes identify SLC6A6 as the most likely DCM gene at the 3p25.1 locus. This gene encodes a taurine transporter whose involvement in myocardial dysfunction and DCM is supported by numerous observations in humans and animals. At the 22q11.23 locus, in silico and data mining annotations, and to a lesser extent functional analysis, strongly suggest SMARCB1 as the candidate culprit gene. CONCLUSION: This study provides a better understanding of the genetic architecture of DCM and sheds light on novel biological pathways underlying heart failure.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity at genomic loci encoding drug targets can be exploited by multivariable Mendelian randomization to provide insight on the pathways by which pharmacological interventions may affect disease risk. However, statistical inference in such investigations may be poor if overdispersion heterogeneity in measured genetic associations is unaccounted for. In this work, we first develop conditional F-statistics for dimension-reduced genetic associations that enable more accurate measurement of phenotypic heterogeneity. We then develop a novel extension for two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization that accounts for overdispersion heterogeneity in dimension-reduced genetic associations. Our empirical focus is to use genetic variants in the GLP1R gene region to understand the mechanism by which GLP1R agonism affects coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Colocalization analyses indicate that distinct variants in the GLP1R gene region are associated with body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses that were corrected for overdispersion heterogeneity suggest that bodyweight lowering rather than type 2 diabetes liability lowering effects of GLP1R agonism are more likely contributing to reduced CAD risk. Tissue-specific analyses prioritised brain tissue as the most likely to be relevant for CAD risk, of the tissues considered. We hope the multivariable Mendelian randomization approach illustrated here is widely applicable to better understand mechanisms linking drug targets to diseases outcomes, and hence to guide drug development efforts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Edoxaban is a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor with proven antithrombotic effects. The long-term efficacy and safety of edoxaban as compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation is not known. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial comparing two once-daily regimens of edoxaban with warfarin in 21,105 patients with moderate-to-high-risk atrial fibrillation (median follow-up, 2.8 years). The primary efficacy end point was stroke or systemic embolism. Each edoxaban regimen was tested for noninferiority to warfarin during the treatment period. The principal safety end point was major bleeding. RESULTS The annualized rate of the primary end point during treatment was 1.50\% with warfarin (median time in the therapeutic range, 68.4\%), as compared with 1.18\% with high-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 0.79; 97.5\% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.99; P{\textexclamdown}0.001 for noninferiority) and 1.61\% with low-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 1.07; 97.5\% CI, 0.87 to 1.31; P=0.005 for noninferiority). In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was a trend favoring high-dose edoxaban versus warfarin (hazard ratio, 0.87; 97.5\% CI, 0.73 to 1.04; P=0.08) and an unfavorable trend with low-dose edoxaban versus warfarin (hazard ratio, 1.13; 97.5\% CI, 0.96 to 1.34; P=0.10). The annualized rate of major bleeding was 3.43\% with warfarin versus 2.75\% with high-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.91; P{\textexclamdown}0.001) and 1.61\% with low-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.41 to 0.55; P{\textexclamdown}0.001). The corresponding annualized rates of death from cardiovascular causes were 3.17\% versus 2.74\% (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.01), and 2.71\% (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 0.96; P=0.008), and the corresponding rates of the key secondary end point (a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes) were 4.43\% versus 3.85\% (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 0.96; P=0.005), and 4.23\% (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.86 to 1.05; P=0.32). CONCLUSIONS Both once-daily regimens of edoxaban were noninferior to warfarin with respect to the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism and were associated with significantly lower rates of bleeding and death from cardiovascular causes.

  abstract = {Background-Oxidative stress may contribute to heart failure (HF) progression. Inhibiting xanthine oxidase in hyperuricemic HF patients may improve outcomes. Methods and Results-We randomly assigned 253 patients with symptomatic HF, left ventricular ejection fraction {$\leq$}40\%, and serum uric acid levels {$\geq$}9.5 mg/dL to receive allopurinol (target dose, 600 mg daily) or placebo in a double-blind, multicenter trial. The primary composite end point at 24 weeks was based on survival, worsening HF, and patient global assessment. Secondary end points included change in quality of life, submaximal exercise capacity, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Uric acid levels were significantly reduced with allopurinoLin comparison with placebo (treatment difference,-4.2 [-4.9,-3.5] mg/dL and-3.5 [-4.2,-2.7] mg/dL at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively, both P{\textexclamdown}0.0001). At 24 weeks, there was no significant difference in clinical status between the allopurinol-and placebo-treated patients (worsened 45\% versus 46\%, unchanged 42\% versus 34\%, improved 13\% versus 19\%, respectively; P=0.68). At 12 and 24 weeks, there was no significant difference in change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores or 6-minute walk distances between the 2 groups. At 24 weeks, left ventricular ejection fraction did not change in either group or between groups. Rash occurred more frequently with allopurinol (10\% versus 2\%, P=0.01), but there was no difference in serious adverse event rates between the groups (20\% versus 15\%, P=0.36). Conclusions-In high-risk HF patients with reduced ejection fraction and elevated uric acid levels, xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol failed to improve clinical status, exercise capacity, quality of life, or left ventricular ejection fraction at 24 weeks.},

However, the definition of its genetic architecture is limited by the technical challenge of capturing dynamic flow volumes from cardiac imaging at scale. We present DeepFlow, a deep-learning system to extract cardiac flow and volumes from phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A mixed-linear model applied to 37,653 individuals from the UK Biobank reveals genome-wide significant associations across cardiac dynamic flow volumes spanning from aortic forward velocity to aortic regurgitation fraction. Mendelian randomization reveals a causal role for aortic root size in aortic valve regurgitation. Among the most significant contributing variants, localizing genes (near ELN, PRDM6 and ADAMTS7) are implicated in connective tissue and blood pressure pathways. Here we show that DeepFlow cardiac flow phenotyping at scale, combined with genotyping data, reinforces the contribution of connective tissue genes, blood pressure and root size to aortic valve function.},

The emergence of GIP receptor (GIPR)--GLP1 receptor (GLP1R) co-agonists has fostered growing interest in the actions of GIP and GLP1 in metabolically relevant tissues. Here, we update concepts of how these hormones act beyond the pancreas. The actions of GIP and GLP1 on liver, muscle and adipose tissue, in the control of glucose and lipid homeostasis, are discussed in the context of plausible mechanisms of action. Both the GIPR and GLP1R are expressed in the central nervous system, wherein receptor activation produces anorectic effects enabling weight loss. In preclinical studies, GIP and GLP1 reduce atherosclerosis. Furthermore, GIPR and GLP1R are expressed within the heart and immune system, and GLP1R within the kidney, revealing putative mechanisms linking GIP and GLP1R agonism to cardiorenal protection. We interpret the clinical and mechanistic data obtained for different agents that enable weight loss and glucose control for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively, by activating or blocking GIPR signalling, including the GIPR--GLP1R co-agonist tirzepatide, as well as the GIPR antagonist--GLP1R~agonist AMG-133. Collectively, we update translational concepts of GIP and GLP1 action, while highlighting gaps, areas of uncertainty and controversies meriting ongoing investigation.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) agonists are highly effective agents for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). GLP-1 is also implicated in outcomes of bariatric surgery, including appetite changes and T2D remission. Rare, potentially deleterious mutations in the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor gene (GLP1R) may, therefore, have important implications for pathogenesis of obesity and T2D, and for response to therapeutic interventions. Methods: A custom Axion genotyping array, including 117 rare predicted-deleterious GLP1R mutations (MAF{$<$}0.01 in gnomAD, CADD-PHRED {$>$}= 15), was used to screen 1714 unrelated adults with BMI {$>$}35 kg/m2 from the PMMO study. We also examined the UK Biobank (UKB) exome sequence dataset for rare, predicted-deleterious GLP1R variants and tested their effects on weight and glycaemia-related traits. Results: Thirty-four PMMO participants carried one of the 117 GLP1R variants screened (11 might have been expected using the sum of their gnomAD control MAFs). These 8 variants were associated with T2D in the UKB and subsequent gene-level analysis of the UKB exome sequence dataset (629/39,274 carriers) confirmed that rare GLP1R variants are associated with increased risk of T2D (OR=1.58), as well as with higher HbA1c levels (p= 0.039). Furthermore, our data highlight a potential interaction of these variants with body mass index. Conclusion: Rare, potentially deleterious GLP1R mutations is associated with increased T2D risk, as well as higher HbA1c in UKB participants without diabetes. Future studies should examine the implications of GLP1R mutations for response to GLP1 agonist treatment and explore the observed interactions with obesity in T2D risk, including in larger cohorts with obesity.},

  abstract = {Incretin hormone-based therapy in type 2 diabetes has been widely used, and dipepdityl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which prevent incretin degradation, have become popular oral hypoglycemic agents. The efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors varies from individuals, and factors determining responses to DPP-4 inhibitors have not been fully established. We aimed to investigate whether genetic variations in glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor are associated with responses to DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes.Genetic variations of rs3765467 in GLP-1 receptor were explored in 246 patients with type 2 diabetes who received DPP-4 inhibitors treatment for 24 weeks in addition to previous medication. Patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) {$>$} 7\% and who were naive to any DPP-4 inhibitors were enrolled. Responders were defined as those who showed a {$>$} 10\% reduction in HbA1c after DPP-4 inhibitor treatment.DPP-4 inhibitors improved glycemic parameters and lipid profiles. Compared to the major genotype (GG), a larger proportion of patients with the minor allele genotype (GA/AA) were responders (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.018), and also showing greater HbA1c reductions (1.3{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}1.1 vs 0.9{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}1.2\%; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.022). This genetic effect remained significant even after adjustment for other confounding factors (OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2.00, 95\% CI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.03-3.89).Polymorphism in the GLP-1 receptor may influence DPP-4 inhibitor response. Further studies in larger population will help determine the association between genetic variation and interindividual differences in DPP-4 inhibitor therapy.},

  abstract = {We analyze how measures of adiposity -- body mass index (BMI) and waist~hip ratio (WHR) -- causally influence rates of hospital admission. Conventional analyses of this relationship are susceptible to omitted variable bias from variables that jointly influence both hospital admission and adipose status. We implement a novel quasi-Poisson instrumental variable model in a Mendelian randomization framework, identifying causal effects from random perturbations to germline genetic variation. We estimate the individual and joint effects of BMI, WHR, and WHR adjusted for BMI. We also implement multivariable instrumental variable methods in which the causal effect of one exposure is estimated conditionally on the causal effect of another exposure. Data on 310,471 participants and over 550,000 inpatient admissions in the UK Biobank were used to perform one-sample and two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses. The results supported a causal role of adiposity on hospital admissions, with consistency across all estimates and sensitivity analyses. Point estimates were generally larger than estimates from comparable observational specifications. We observed an attenuation of the BMI effect when adjusting for WHR in the multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses, suggesting that an adverse fat distribution, rather than a higher BMI itself, may drive the relationship between adiposity and risk of hospital admission.},

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide receptor (GIPR) are their indirect drug targets. Variants of GLP1R and GIPR have previously been associated with the incretin effect. The aim of the present pilot study was to examine associations of the GLP1R and GIPR gene variants with the glycaemic response to gliptins. A total of 140 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes were followed-up 6\,months after initiation of gliptin treatment. GLP1R rs6923761 (Gly168Ser) and GIPR rs10423928 genotyping was performed using real-time PCR, with subsequent high-resolution melting analysis. The main study outcome was reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) after treatment. GLP1R Gly168Ser variant was significantly associated with reduction in HbA1c in an additive model ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.33, p\,=\,0.011). The mean reduction in HbA1c in Ser/Ser homozygotes was significantly lower compared with Gly-allele carriers [0.12\,{\textpm}\,0.23\% vs. 0.80\,{\textpm}\,0.09\% (1.3\,{\textpm}\,2.5\,mmol/mol vs. 8.7\,{\textpm}\,1.0\,mmol/mol); p\,=\,0.008]. In conclusion, GLP1R missense variant was associated with a reduced response to gliptin treatment. The genotype-related effect size of {$\sim$}0.7\% (8\,mmol/mol) is equal to an average effect of gliptin treatment and makes this variant a candidate for use in precision medicine.},

The potential role of genetic variability of GLP-1R on body weight response to GLP-1 RAs in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: Fifty-seven obese women with PCOS (aged 30.7 {\textpm} 7.0, BMI 38.6 {\textpm} 5.3 kg/m(2)) were assigned to liraglutide 1.2 mg QD s.c. for 12 weeks and classified as strong responders regarding weight loss if they lost 5\% or more of their initial body weight. They were genotyped for common GLP-1R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6923761 and rs10305420. Changes of measures of obesity were measured before and at the end of the treatment. RESULTS: Twenty out of 57 subjects were strong responders and lost 7.38 {\textpm} 1.74 compared to 2.11 {\textpm} 2.17 kg lost in poor responders. Carriers of at least one polymorphic rs10305420 allele had poor treatment response compared to carriers of two wild type alleles (OR = 0.27, 95\% CI = 0.09-0.85, P = 0.025). Carriers of at least one polymorphic rs6923761 allele tended to have stronger treatment response compared to carriers of two wild type alleles (OR = 3.06, 95\% CI = 0.96-9.74, P = 0.058). Fasting glucose and glucose after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) comparably decreased in both groups when compared to baseline, whereas no within treatment differences were found in androgen profile. Gastrointestinal adverse events were transit and balanced between strong and poor responders. CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1R rs10305420 polymorphism explained some of the inter-individual differences in response to liraglutide regarding weight loss in obese PCOS women.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the heritability as well as genetic and environmental correlations of left ventricular (LV) structural and functional traits in complex pedigrees of a Caucasian population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly recruited 459 white European subjects from 52 families (50\% women; mean age 45 years). LV structure was measured by M-mode and 2D echocardiography and LV function was measured by conventional Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Other measurements included blood pressure, anthropometric, and biochemical measurements. We estimated the heritability of LV traits while adjusting for covariables, including sex, age, body height and weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart rate. With full adjustment, heritability of LV mass was 0.23 (P= 0.025). The TDI-derived mitral annular velocities Ea and Aa showed moderate heritability (h(2)= 0.36 and 0.53, respectively), whereas the mitral inflow A peak had weak heritability (h(2) = 0.25) and the E peak was not heritable (h(2) = 0.11). We partitioned the total phenotypic correlation when it reached significance, into a genetic and an environmental component. The genetic correlations were 0.61 between the E and Ea peaks and 0.90 between the A and Aa peaks. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated moderate heritability for LV mass as well as the mitral annular Ea and Aa peaks. We also found significant genetic correlations between the E and Ea peaks and between the A and Aa peaks. Our current findings support the ongoing research to map and detect genetic variants that contribute to the variation in LV mass and other LV structural and functional phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Background We compared the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 with enalapril in patients who had heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. In previous studies, enalapril improved survival in such patients. Methods: In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 8442 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40\% or less to receive either LCZ696 (at a dose of 200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily), in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial was designed to detect a difference in the rates of death from cardiovascular causes. Results: The trial was stopped early, according to prespecified rules, after a median followup of 27 months, because the boundary for an overwhelming benefit with LCZ696 had been crossed. At the time of study closure, the primary outcome had occurred in 914 patients (21.8\%) in the LCZ696 group and 1117 patients (26.5\%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio in the LCZ696 group, 0.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87; P{\textexclamdown} 0.001). A total of 711 patients (17.0\%) receiving LCZ696 and 835 patients (19.8\%) receiving enalapril died (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 0.93; P{\textexclamdown} 0.001); of these patients, 558 (13.3\%) and 693 (16.5\%), respectively, died from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.89; P{\textexclamdown} 0.001). As compared with enalapril, LCZ696 also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 21\% (P{\textexclamdown} 0.001) and decreased the symptoms and physical limitations of heart failure (P = 0.001). The LCZ696 group had higher proportions of patients with hypotension and nonserious angioedema but lower proportions with renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough than the enalapril group. Conclusions: LCZ696 was superior to enalapril in reducing the risks of death and of hospitalization for heart failure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND - Statins reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients, but their potential benefit as treatment for heart failure (HF) is less clear. METHODS AND RESULTS - Patients (n=10 001) with stable coronary disease were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin 80 or 10 mg/d and followed up for a median of 4.9 years. A history of HF was present in 7.8\% of patients. A known ejection fraction {\textexclamdown}30\% and advanced HF were exclusion criteria for the study. A predefined secondary end point of the study was hospitalization for HF. The incidence of hospitalization for HF was 2.4\% in the 80-mg arm and 3.3\% in the 10-mg arm (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95\% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.94; P=0.0116). The treatment effect of the higher dose was more marked in patients with a history of HF: 17.3\% versus 10.6\% in the 10- and 80-mg arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95\% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.88; P=0.009). Among patients without a history of HF, the rates of hospitalization for HF were much lower: 1.8\% in the 80-mg group and 2.0\% in the 10-mg group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval, 0.64 to 1.16; P=0.34). Only one third of patients hospitalized for HF had evidence of preceding angina or myocardial infarction during the study period. Blood pressure was almost identical during follow-up in the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS - Compared with a lower dose, intensive treatment with atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease significantly reduces hospitalizations for HF. In a post hoc analysis, this benefit was observed only in patients with a history of HF. The mechanism accounting for this benefit is unlikely to be due primarily to a reduction in interim coronary events or differences in blood pressure. {\copyright} 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.},

  abstract = {Leveraging high-dimensional molecular datasets can help us develop mechanistic insight into associations between genetic variants and complex traits. In this study, we integrated human proteome data derived from brain tissue to evaluate whether targeted proteins putatively mediate the effects of genetic variants on seven neurological phenotypes (Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depression, insomnia, intelligence, neuroticism, and schizophrenia). Applying the principles of Mendelian randomization (MR) systematically across the genome highlighted 43 effects between genetically predicted proteins derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and these outcomes. Furthermore, genetic colocalization provided evidence that the same causal variant at 12 of these loci was responsible for variation in both protein and neurological phenotype. This included genes such as DCC, which encodes the netrin-1 receptor and has an important role in the development of the nervous system (p = 4.29~{\texttimes} 10-11 with neuroticism), as well as SARM1, which has been previously implicated in axonal degeneration (p = 1.76~{\texttimes} 10-08 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We additionally conducted a phenome-wide MR study for each of these 12 genes to assess potential pleiotropic effects on 700 complex traits and diseases. Our findings suggest that genes such as SNX32, which was initially associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease, may potentially influence other complex traits in the opposite direction. In contrast, genes such as CTSH (which was also associated with Alzheimer disease) and SARM1 may make worthwhile therapeutic targets because they did not have genetically predicted effects on any of the other phenotypes after correcting for multiple testing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with systolic heart failure have generally been excluded from statin trials. Acute coronary events are uncommon in this population, and statins have theoretical risks in these patients. METHODS: A total of 5011 patients at least 60 years of age with New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV ischemic, systolic heart failure were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of rosuvastatin or placebo per day. The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included death from any cause, any coronary event, death from cardiovascular causes, and the number of hospitalizations. RESULTS: As compared with the placebo group, patients in the rosuvastatin group had decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (difference between groups, 45.0\%; P{\textexclamdown}0.001) and of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (difference between groups, 37.1\%; P{\textexclamdown}0.001). During a median follow-up of 32.8 months, the primary outcome occurred in 692 patients in the rosuvastatin group and 732 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.02; P=0.12), and 728 patients and 759 patients, respectively, died (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.86 to 1.05; P=0.31). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the coronary outcome or death from cardiovascular causes. In a prespecified secondary analysis, there were fewer hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes in the rosuvastatin group (2193) than in the placebo group (2564) (P{\textexclamdown}0.001). No excessive episodes of muscle-related or other adverse events occurred in the rosuvastatin group. CONCLUSIONS: Rosuvastatin did not reduce the primary outcome or the number of deaths from any cause in older patients with systolic heart failure, although the drug did reduce the number of cardiovascular hospitalizations. The drug did not cause safety problems. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00206310.) Copyright ? 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society.},

  abstract = {Aims: Evidence on the association of macrophage- and neutrophil-related blood biomarkers with clinical outcome in heart failure patients is limited, and, with the exception of C-reactive protein, no data exist on their temporal evolution. We aimed to investigate whether temporal patterns of these biomarkers are related to clinical outcome in patients with stable chronic heart failure (CHF). Methods and Results: In 263 patients with CHF, we performed serial plasma measurements of scavenger receptor cysteine-rich type 1 protein M130 (CD163), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (TRAP), granulins (GRN), spondin-1 (SPON1), peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The Cardiovascular Panel III (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used. During 2.2 years of follow-up, we collected 1984 samples before the occurrence of the composite primary endpoint (PE) or censoring. For efficiency, we selected 567 samples for the measurements (all baseline samples, the last two samples preceding the PE, and the last sample before censoring in event-free patients). The relationship between repeatedly measured biomarker levels and the PE was evaluated by joint models. Mean ({\textpm}standard deviation) age was 67 {\textpm} 13 years; 189 (72\%) were men; left ventricular ejection fraction (\%) was 32 {\textpm} 11. During follow-up, 70 (27\%) patients experienced the PE. Serially measured biomarkers predicted the PE in a multivariable model adjusted for baseline clinical characteristics [hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval) per 1-standard deviation change in biomarker]: CD163 [2.07(1.47--2.98), P {\textexclamdown} 0.001], TRAP [0.62 (0.43--0.90), P = 0.009], GRN [2.46 (1.64--3.84), P {\textexclamdown} 0.001], SPON1 [3.94 (2.50--6.50), P {\textexclamdown} 0.001], and PGLYRP1 [1.62 (1.14--2.31), P = 0.006]. Conclusions: Changes in plasma levels of CD163, TRAP, GRN, SPON1, and PGLYRP1 precede adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHF.},

  abstract = {The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a key physiological regulator of insulin secretion and a major therapeutic target for the treatment of type II diabetes. However, regulation of GLP-1R function is complex with multiple endogenous peptides that interact with the receptor, including full-length (1--37) and truncated (7--37) forms of GLP-1 that can exist in an amidated form (GLP-1(1--36)NH2 and GLP-1(7--36)NH2) and the related peptide oxyntomodulin. In addition, the GLP-1R possesses exogenous agonists, including exendin-4, and the allosteric modulator, compound 2 (6,7-dichloro-2-methylsulfonyl-3-tert-butylaminoquinoxaline). The complexity of this ligand-receptor system is further increased by the presence of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are distributed across the receptor. We have investigated 10 GLP-1R SNPs, which were characterized in three physiologically relevant signaling pathways (cAMP accumulation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization); ligand binding and cell surface receptor expression were also determined. We demonstrate both ligand- and pathway-specific effects for multiple SNPs, with the most dramatic effect observed for the Met149 receptor variant. At the Met149 variant, there was selective loss of peptide-induced responses across all pathways examined, but preservation of response to the small molecule compound 2. In contrast, at the Cys333 variant, peptide responses were preserved but there was attenuated response to compound 2. Strikingly, the loss of peptide function at the Met149 receptor variant could be allosterically rescued by compound 2, providing proof-of-principle evidence that allosteric drugs could be used to treat patients with this loss of function variant.},

  abstract = {Conventional measurements of fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels investigated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) cannot capture the effects of DNA variability on `around the clock' glucoregulatory processes. Here we show that GWAS meta-analysis of glucose measurements under nonstandardized conditions (random glucose (RG)) in 476,326 individuals of diverse ancestries and without diabetes enables locus discovery and innovative pathophysiological observations. We discovered 120 RG loci represented by 150 distinct signals, including 13 with sex-dimorphic effects, two cross-ancestry and seven rare frequency signals. Of these, 44 loci are new for glycemic traits. Regulatory, glycosylation and metagenomic annotations highlight ileum and colon tissues, indicating an underappreciated role of the gastrointestinal tract in controlling blood glucose. Functional follow-up and molecular dynamics simulations of lower frequency coding variants in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R), a type 2 diabetes treatment target, reveal that optimal selection of GLP-1R agonist therapy will benefit from tailored genetic stratification. We also provide evidence from Mendelian randomization that lung function is modulated by blood glucose and that pulmonary dysfunction is a diabetes complication. Our investigation yields new insights into the biology of glucose regulation, diabetes complications and pathways for treatment stratification.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between heart failure in parents and the prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and the risk of heart failure in their offspring has not been investigated in a community-based setting. METHODS: We examined the cross-sectional association of heart failure in parents with the prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as well as left ventricular mass, internal dimensions, and wall thickness, in 1497 participants of the Framingham Offspring Study (mean age, 57 years; 819 women) who underwent routine echocardiography. We also investigated prospectively whether heart failure in parents increased the risk of heart failure in 2214 offspring (mean age, 44 years; 1150 women). RESULTS: As compared with the 1039 participants whose parents did not have heart failure, the 458 participants in the cross-sectional cohort who had at least one parent with heart failure were more likely to have increased left ventricular mass (17.0 percent vs. 26.9 percent), left ventricular internal dimensions (18.6 percent vs. 23.4 percent), and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (3.1 percent vs. 5.7 percent); the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios were 1.35 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.84), 1.29 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.72), and 2.37 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 4.61), respectively. In the longitudinal cohort, heart failure developed in 90 offspring during follow-up (mean length of follow-up, 20 years). The age- and sex-adjusted 10-year incidence rates of heart failure were 2.72 percent among offspring with a parent with heart failure, as compared with 1.62 percent among those without a parent with heart failure. This increase in risk persisted after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.60). CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure in parents is associated with an increased prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction cross-sectionally and an elevated risk of heart failure longitudinally. Our data emphasize the contribution of familial factors to the heart-failure burden in the community.},

  abstract = {Body mass index (BMI) is a complex disease risk factor known to be influenced by genes acting via both metabolic pathways and appetite regulation. In this study, we aimed to gain insight into the phenotypic consequences of BMI-associated genetic variants, which may be mediated by their expression in different tissues. First, we harnessed meta-analyzed gene expression datasets derived from subcutaneous adipose (n = 1257) and brain (n = 1194) tissue to identify 86 and 140 loci, respectively, which provided evidence of genetic colocalization with BMI. These two sets of tissue-partitioned loci had differential effects with respect to waist-to-hip ratio, suggesting that the way they influence fat distribution might vary despite their having very similar average magnitudes of effect on BMI itself (adipose = 0.0148 and brain = 0.0149 standard deviation change in BMI per effect allele). For instance, BMI-associated variants colocalized with TBX15 expression in adipose tissue (posterior probability [PPA] = 0.97), but not when we used TBX15 expression data derived from brain tissue (PPA = 0.04) This gene putatively influences BMI via its role in skeletal development. Conversely, there were loci where BMI-associated variants provided evidence of colocalization with gene expression in brain tissue (e.g., NEGR1, PPA = 0.93), but not when we used data derived from adipose tissue, suggesting that these genes might be more likely to influence BMI via energy balance. Leveraging these tissue-partitioned variant sets through a multivariable Mendelian randomization framework provided strong evidence that the brain-tissue-derived variants are predominantly responsible for driving the genetically predicted effects of BMI on cardiovascular-disease endpoints (e.g., coronary artery disease: odds ratio = 1.05, 95\% confidence interval = 1.04-1.07, p~= 4.67~{\texttimes} 10-14). In contrast, our analyses suggested that the adipose tissue variants might predominantly be responsible for the underlying relationship between BMI and measures of cardiac function, such as left ventricular stroke volume (beta = 0.21, 95\% confidence interval = 0.09-0.32, p = 6.43~{\texttimes} 10-4).},

All 13 exons and intron-exon boundaries of the GLP1R gene were amplified to investigate the association. Results. The short tandem repeat at 8GA/7GA (rs5875654) had complete linkage disequilibrium (LD, with ) with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs761386. Quantitative trait loci analysis of GLP1R gene variation with clinical response of GLP1 analogue showed the missense rs3765467 and rs761386 significantly associated with changes in the standard deviation of plasma glucose () ( and 0.019, resp.). The reported values became insignificant after multiple testing adjustments. Conclusion. The variable response to the GLP-1 analogue was not statistically correlated with polymorphisms of the GLP1R gene in patients with poorly controlled type 2 DM.},

  abstract = {The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a class B G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and diabetes drug target expressed mainly in pancreatic {$\beta$}-cells that, when activated by its agonist glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) after a meal, stimulates insulin secretion and {$\beta$}-cell survival and proliferation. The N-terminal region of GLP-1 interacts with membrane-proximal residues of GLP-1R, stabilizing its active conformation to trigger intracellular signaling. The best-studied agonist peptides, GLP-1 and exendin-4, share sequence homology at their N-terminal region; however, modifications that can be tolerated here are not fully understood. In this work, a functional screen of GLP-1 variants with randomized N-terminal domains reveals new GLP-1R agonists and uncovers a pattern whereby a negative charge is preferred at the third position in various sequence contexts. We further tested this sequence--structure--activity principle by synthesizing peptide analogues where this position was mutated to both canonical and noncanonical amino acids. We discovered a highly active GLP-1 analogue in which the native glutamate residue three positions from the N-terminus was replaced with the sulfo-containing amino acid cysteic acid (GLP-1-CYA). The receptor binding and downstream signaling properties elicited by GLP-1-CYA were similar to the wild type GLP-1 peptide. Computational modeling identified a likely mode of interaction of the negatively charged side chain in GLP-1-CYA with an arginine on GLP-1R. This work highlights a strategy of combinatorial peptide screening coupled with chemical exploration that could be used to generate novel agonists for other receptors with peptide ligands.},

  abstract = {Importance: Abnormal cardiac metabolism contributes to the pathophysiology of advanced heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists have shown cardioprotective effects in early clinical studies of patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status. Objective: To test whether therapy with a GLP-1 agonist improves clinical stability following hospitalization for acute heart failure. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of patients with established heart failure and reduced LVEF who were recently hospitalized. Patients were enrolled between August 2013 and March 2015 at 24 US sites. Interventions: The GLP-1 agonist liraglutide (n = 154) or placebo (n = 146) via a daily subcutaneous injection; study drug was advanced to a dosage of 1.8mg/d during the first 30 days as tolerated and continued for 180 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a global rank score in which all patients, regardless of treatment assignment, were ranked across 3 hierarchical tiers: time to death, time to rehospitalization for heart failure, and time-averaged proportional change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level from baseline to 180 days. Higher values indicate better health (stability). Exploratory secondary outcomes included primary end point components, cardiac structure and function, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, and combined events. Results: Among the 300 patients whowere randomized (median age, 61 years [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 52-68 years]; 64 [21\%] women; 178 [59\%] with type 2 diabetes; median LVEF of 25\% [IQR, 19\%-33\%]; median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2049 pg/mL [IQR, 1054-4235 pg/mL]), 271 completed the study. Compared with placebo, liraglutide had no significant effect on the primary end point (mean rank of 146 for the liraglutide group vs 156 for the placebo group, P = .31). Therewere no significant between-group differences in the number of deaths (19 [12\%] in the liraglutide group vs 16 [11\%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 1.10 [95\%CI, 0.57-2.14]; P = .78) or rehospitalizations for heart failure (63 [41\%] vs 50 [34\%], respectively; hazard ratio, 1.30 [95\%CI, 0.89-1.88]; P = .17) or for the exploratory secondary end points. Prespecified subgroup analyses in patients with diabetes did not reveal any significant between-group differences. The number of investigator-reported hyperglycemic eventswas 16 (10\%) in the liraglutide group vs 27 (18\%) in the placebo group and hypoglycemic eventswere infrequent (2 [1\%] vs 4 [3\%], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients recently hospitalized with heart failure and reduced LVEF, the use of liraglutide did not lead to greater posthospitalization clinical stability. These findings do not support the use of liraglutide in this clinical situation.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives The genetic basis of Parkinson disease (PD) motor progression is largely unknown. Previous studies of the genetics of PD progression have included small cohorts and shown a limited overlap with genetic PD risk factors from case-control studies. Here, we have studied genomic variation associated with PD motor severity and early-stage progression in large longitudinal cohorts to help to define the biology of PD progression and potential new drug targets. Methods We performed a GWAS meta-analysis of early PD motor severity and progression up to 3 years from study entry. We used linear mixed-effect models with additive effects, corrected for age at diagnosis, sex, and the first 5 genetic principal components to assess variability in axial, limb, and total Movement Disorder Society--Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III scores. Results We included 3,572 unrelated European ancestry patients with PD from 5 observational cohorts and 1 drug trial. The average AAO was 62.6 years (SD = 9.83), and 63\% of participants were male. We found an average increase in the total MDS-UPDRS III score of 2.3 points/year. We identified an association between PD axial motor progression and variation at the GJA5 locus at 1q12 ({$\beta$} = -0.25, SE = 0.04, p = 3.4e-10). Exploration of the regulation of gene expression in the region (cis-expression quantitative trait loci [eQTL] analysis) showed that the lead variant was associated with expression of ACP6, a lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase that regulates mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis (cis-eQTL p-values in blood and brain RNA expression data sets: {$<$}10-14 in eQTLGen and 10-7 in PsychEncode). Discussion Our study highlights the potential role of mitochondrial lipid homeostasis in the progression of PD, which may be important in establishing new drug targets that might modify disease progression.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Lost glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) function affects human physiology. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to identify coding nonsynonymous GLP1R variants in Danish individuals to link their in vitro phenotypes and clinical phenotypic associations. METHODS: We sequenced GLP1R in 8642 Danish individuals with type 2 diabetes or normal glucose tolerance and examined the ability of nonsynonymous variants to bind GLP-1 and to signal in transfected cells via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation and {$\beta$}-arrestin recruitment. We performed a cross-sectional study between the burden of loss-of-signaling (LoS) variants and cardiometabolic phenotypes in 2930 patients with type 2 diabetes and 5712 participants in a population-based cohort. Furthermore, we studied the association between cardiometabolic phenotypes and the burden of the LoS variants and 60 partly overlapping predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) GLP1R variants found in 330 566 unrelated White exome-sequenced participants in the UK Biobank cohort. RESULTS: We identified 36 nonsynonymous variants in GLP1R, of which 10 had a statistically significant loss in GLP-1-induced cAMP signaling compared to wild-type. However, no association was observed between the LoS variants and type 2 diabetes, although LoS variant carriers had a minor increased fasting plasma glucose level. Moreover, pLoF variants from the UK Biobank also did not reveal substantial cardiometabolic associations, despite a small effect on glycated hemoglobin A1c. CONCLUSION: Since no homozygous LoS nor pLoF variants were identified and heterozygous carriers had similar cardiometabolic phenotype as noncarriers, we conclude that GLP-1R may be of particular importance in human physiology, due to a potential evolutionary intolerance of harmful homozygous GLP1R variants.},

  abstract = {Introduction Obesity is a complex disease associated with excessive fat accumulation and numerous metabolic complications. So far, many factors leading to the development of this disorder have been identified, including genetic susceptibility. Various studies linked GLP1R variants with anthropometric and metabolic parameters, suggesting the role of the variation in this gene in metabolic health. Objective The aim of this study is to investigate the association of two single nucleotide variants of GLP1R gene, rs2268641 and rs6923761, with excessive weight, metabolic syndrome, anthropometric measurements and selected metabolic parameters. Methods Normal-weight subjects (n= 340, control group) and subjects with excessive body mass (n = 600, study group) participated in this study. For all participants, anthropometric measurements and metabolic parameters were collected, and genotyping of the two single nucleotide variants of GLP1R gene, rs2268641 and rs6923761, was performed using the high-resolution melting curve analysis. Results Significant differences in the genotype distribution of rs2268641 were found, where homozygous TT genotype was significantly less frequent in the study group with excessive body mass (OR=0.66; p=0.0298). For rs6923761, A allele and homozygous AA genotype were significantly more frequent in the study group with excessive weight than in the control group (OR=1.27; p=0.0239 and OR=1.69; p=0.0205, respectively). The association of studied variants with metabolic parameters was found for rs6923761. For this variant, AA carriers had higher body mass in comparison to GG carriers (p=0.0246), and AA carriers had higher glucose concentration in comparison to AG carriers (p=0.0498). We did not find an association of rs2268641 and rs6923761 with metabolic syndrome. Conclusion In our study, AA carriers of rs6923761 had higher risk of excessive body mass, whereas TT carriers of rs2268641 had lower risk of being overweight. Moreover, homozygous carriers of the minor allele of rs6923761 had higher glucose concentration in comparison to heterozygous subjects. None of the studied variants were associated with metabolic syndrome in the studied population.},

  abstract = {Genetic studies of disease progression can be used to identify factors that may influence survival or prognosis, which may differ from factors that influence on disease susceptibility. Studies of disease progression feed directly into therapeutics for disease, whereas studies of incidence inform prevention strategies. However, studies of disease progression are known to be affected by collider (also known as "index event") bias since the disease progression phenotype can only be observed for individuals who have the disease. This applies equally to observational and genetic studies, including genome-wide association studies and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. In this paper, our aim is to review several statistical methods that can be used to detect and adjust for index event bias in studies of disease progression, and how they apply to genetic and MR studies using both individual- and summary-level data. Methods to detect the presence of index event bias include the use of negative controls, a comparison of associations between risk factors for incidence in individuals with and without the disease, and an inspection of Miami plots. Methods to adjust for the bias include inverse probability weighting (with individual-level data), or Slope-Hunter and Dudbridge et al.'s index event bias adjustment (when only summary-level data are available). We also outline two approaches for sensitivity analysis. We then illustrate how three methods to minimise bias can be used in practice with two applied examples. Our first example investigates the effects of blood lipid traits on mortality from coronary heart disease, while our second example investigates genetic associations with breast cancer mortality.},

METHODS: We conducted a series of systematic literature searches on the pharmacogenetics of HF therapy to assess the current knowledge on this field. RESULTS: Existing data related to HF pharmacogenomics are still limited. The ADRB1 gene is a likely candidate to predict response to {$\beta$}-blockers. Moreover, the cytochrome P450 2D6 coding gene (CYP2D6) clearly affects the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, although the clinical impact of this association remains to be established. CONCLUSION: Given the rising prevalence of HF and related costs, a more personalized use of HF drugs could have a remarkable benefit for patients, caregivers and healthcare systems.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in coronary artery disease (CAD) had identified 66 loci at 'genome-wide significance' (P {$<$} 5 {\texttimes} 10-8) at the time of this analysis, but a much larger number of putative loci at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5\% (refs. 1,2,3,4). Here we leverage an interim release of UK Biobank (UKBB) data to evaluate the validity of the FDR approach. We tested a CAD phenotype inclusive of angina (SOFT; ncases = 10,801) as well as a stricter definition without angina (HARD; ncases = 6,482) and selected cases with the former phenotype to conduct a meta-analysis using the two most recent CAD GWAS. This approach identified 13 new loci at genome-wide significance, 12 of which were on our previous list of loci meeting the 5\% FDR threshold, thus providing strong support that the remaining loci identified by FDR represent genuine signals. The 304 independent variants associated at 5\% FDR in this study explain 21.2\% of CAD heritability and identify 243 loci that implicate pathways in blood vessel morphogenesis as well as lipid metabolism, nitric oxide signaling and inflammation.},

  abstract = {Guidelines recommend that exercise training be considered for medically stable outpatients with heart failure. Previous studies have not had adequate statistical power to measure the effects of exercise training on clinical outcomes. Objective To test the efficacy and safety of exercise training among patients with heart failure. Design, Setting, and Patients Multicenter, randomized controlled trial of 2331 medically stable outpatients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Participants in Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) were randomized from April 2003 through February 2007 at 82 centers within the United States, Canada, and France; median follow-up was 30 months. Interventions Usual care plus aerobic exercise training, consisting of 36 supervised sessions followed by home-based training, or usual care alone. Main Outcome Measures Composite primary end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization and prespecified secondary end points of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization. Results The median age was 59 years, 28\% were women, and 37\% had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms. Heart failure etiology was ischemic in 51\%, and median left ventricular ejection fraction was 25\%. Exercise adherence decreased from a median of 95 minutes per week during months 4 through 6 of follow-up to 74 minutes per week during months 10 through 12. A total of 759 patients (65\%) in the exercise training group died or were hospitalized compared with 796 patients (68\%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93 [95\% confidence interval \{Cl\}, 0.84-1.02]; P=.13). There were nonsignificant reductions in the exercise training group for mortality (189 patients [16\%] in the exercise training group vs 198 patients [17\%] in the usual care group; HR, 0.96 [95\% Cl, 0.79-1.17]; P=.7O), cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization (632 [55\%] in the exercise training group vs 677 [58\%] in the usual care group; HR, 0.92 [95\% Cl, 0.83-1.03]; P=.14), and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization (344 [30\%] in the exercise training group vs 393 [34\%] in the usual care group; HR, 0.87 [95\% Cl, 0.75-1.00]; P=.O6). In prespecified supplementary analyses adjusting for highly prognostic baseline characteristics, the HRs were 0.89 (95\% Cl, 0.81-0.99; P=.03) for all-cause mortality or hospitalization, 0.91 (95\% Cl, 0.82-1.01; P=.O9) for cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, and 0.85 (95\% Cl, 0.74-0.99; P= .03) for cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization. Other adverse events were similar between the groups. Conclusions In the protocol-specified primary analysis, exercise training resulted in nonsignificant reductions in the primary end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization and in key secondary clinical end points. After adjustment for highly prognostic predictors of the primary end point, exercise training was associated with modest significant reductions for both all-cause mortality or hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization. {\copyright} 2009 American Medical Association.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) has been hypothesized to be involved in atherogenesis through pathways related to inflammation. Darapladib is an oral, selective inhibitor of the Lp-PLA2 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of darapladib in patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: SOLID-TIMI 52 was a multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 13,026 participants within 30 days of hospitalization with an ACS (non-ST-elevation or ST-elevation myocardial infarction [MI]) at 868 sites in 36 countries. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to either once-daily darapladib (160 mg) or placebo on a background of guideline-recommended therapy. Patients were followed up for a median of 2.5 years between December 7, 2009, and December 6, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point (major coronary events) was the composite of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, MI, or urgent coronary revascularization for myocardial ischemia. Kaplan-Meier event rates are reported at 3 years. RESULTS: During a median duration of 2.5 years, the primary end point occurred in 903 patients in the darapladib group and 910 in the placebo group (16.3\% vs 15.6\% at 3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.00 [95\% CI, 0.91-1.09]; P\,=\,.93). The composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke occurred in 824 in the darapladib group and 838 in the placebo group (15.0\% vs 15.0\% at 3 years; HR, 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.90-1.09]; P\,=\,.78). There were no differences between the treatment groups for additional secondary end points, for individual components of the primary end point, or in all-cause mortality (371 events in the darapladib group and 395 in the placebo group [7.3\% vs 7.1\% at 3 years; HR, 0.94 [95\% CI, 0.82-1.08]; P\,=\,.40). Patients were more likely to report an odor-related concern in the darapladib group vs the placebo group (11.5\% vs 2.5\%) and also more likely to report diarrhea (10.6\% vs 5.6\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients who experienced an ACS event, direct inhibition of Lp-PLA2 with darapladib added to optimal medical therapy and initiated within 30 days of hospitalization did not reduce the risk of major coronary events.

The potentially protective effect of increased BMI in CHF has been termed the obesity paradox or reverse epidemiology. This meta-analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between increased BMI and mortality in patients with CHF.{\textbar}We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify studies with contemporaneous control groups (cohort, case-control, or randomized controlled trials) that examined the effect of obesity on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and performed data extraction.{\textbar}Nine observational studies met final inclusion criteria (total n = 28,209). Mean length of follow-up was 2.7 years. Compared to individuals without elevated BMI levels, both overweight (BMI approximately 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2), RR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.79-0.90) and obesity (BMI approximately {$>$} or =30 kg/m(2), RR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.62-0.73) were associated with lower all-cause mortality. Overweight (RR 0.81, 95\% CI 0.72-0.92) and obesity (RR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.53-0.69) were also associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. In a risk-adjusted sensitivity analysis, both obesity (adjusted HR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.83-0.93) and overweight (adjusted HR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.89-0.97) remained protective against mortality.{\textbar}Overweight and obesity were associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates in patients with CHF and were not associated with increased mortality in any study. There is a need for prospective studies to elucidate mechanisms for this relationship.},

In this manuscript, we describe functions that have been added or edited in the package since version 0.5.0, when we last described the package and its contents. The main additions to the package since that time are: 1) new robust methods for performing Mendelian randomization, particularly in the cases of bias from weak instruments and/or winner's curse, and pleiotropic variants, 2) methods for performing Mendelian randomization with correlated variants using dimension reduction to summarize large numbers of highly correlated variants into a limited set of principal components, 3) functions for calculating first-stage F statistics, representing instrument strength, in both univariable and multivariable contexts, and with uncorrelated and correlated genetic variants. We also discuss some pragmatic issues relating to the use of correlated variants in Mendelian randomization.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity at genomic loci encoding drug targets can be exploited by multivariable Mendelian randomization to provide insight on the pathways by which pharmacological interventions may affect disease risk. However, statistical inference in such investigations may be poor if overdispersion heterogeneity in measured genetic associations is unaccounted for. In this work, we first develop conditional F-statistics for dimension-reduced genetic associations that enable more accurate measurement of phenotypic heterogeneity. We then develop a novel extension for two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization that accounts for overdispersion heterogeneity in dimension-reduced genetic associations. Our empirical focus is to use genetic variants in the GLP1R gene region to understand the mechanism by which GLP1R agonism affects coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Colocalization analyses indicate that distinct variants in the GLP1R gene region are associated with body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses that were corrected for overdispersion heterogeneity suggest that bodyweight lowering rather than type 2 diabetes liability lowering effects of GLP1R agonism are more likely contributing to reduced CAD risk. Tissue-specific analyses prioritised brain tissue as the most likely to be relevant for CAD risk, of the tissues considered. We hope the multivariable Mendelian randomization approach illustrated here is widely applicable to better understand mechanisms linking drug targets to diseases outcomes, and hence to guide drug development efforts.},

However, much of the perceived benefit of such discoveries lies in the promise that the identification of genes that influence disease would directly translate into the identification of potential therapeutic targets, but this has yet to be realized at a level reflecting expectation. One reason for this, we suggest, is that GWAS, to date, have generally not focused on phenotypes that directly relate to the progression of disease and thus speak to disease treatment.},

Objective: To compare the effects of 2 strategies of lipid lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI). Design, Setting, and Participants: The IDEAL study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial conducted at 190 ambulatory cardiology care and specialist practices in northern Europe between March 1999 and March 2005 with a median follow-up of 4.8 years, which enrolled 8888 patients aged 80 years or younger with a history of acute MI. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/d; n=4439), or usual-dose simvastatin (20 mg/d; n=4449). Main Outcome Measure: Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. Results: During treatment, mean LDL-C levels were 104 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 81 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the atorvastatin group. A major coronary event occurred in 463 simvastatin patients (10.4\%) and in 411 atorvastatin patients (9.3\%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.78-1.01; P=.07). Nonfatal acute MI occurred in 321 (7.2\%) and 267 (6.0\%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.98; P=.02), but no differences were seen in the 2 other components of the primary end point. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 608 and 533 in the 2 groups, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.77-0.98; P=.02). Occurrence of any coronary event was reported in 1059 simvastatin and 898 atorvastatin patients (HR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.76-0.91; P{\textexclamdown}.001). Noncardiovascular death occurred in 156 (3.5\%) and 143 (3.2\%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.73-1.15; P=.47). Death from any cause occurred in 374 (8.4\%) in the simvastatin group and 366 (8.2\%) in the atorvastatin group (HR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.13; P=.81). Patients in the atorvastatin group had higher rates of drug discontinuation due to nonserious adverse events; transaminase elevation resulted in 43 (1.0\%) vs 5 (0.1\%) withdrawals (P{\textexclamdown}.001). Serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were rare in both groups. Conclusions: In this study of patients with previous MI, intensive lowering of LDL-C did not result in a significant reduction in the primary outcome of major coronary events, but did reduce the risk of other composite secondary end points and nonfatal acute MI. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Patients with MI may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL-C without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3319 patients) or placebo (3313 patients) [correction] in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1012 deaths occurred. The primary end points were death from any cause and death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia. RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; P=0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; P=0.005). The rate of the other primary end point, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; P=0.002), as was the secondary end point of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; P=0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; P=0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (P=0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (P{\textexclamdown}0.001). CONCLUSIONS The addition of eplerenone to optimal medical therapy reduces morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants associated with complex traits, but their biological interpretation often remains unclear. Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs, indicating their potential involvement in regulation of gene expression. Here, we propose a transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously. Applied to 43 human phenotypes, it uncovers 3,913 putatively causal gene--trait associations, 36\% of which have no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS. Using independent association summary statistics, we find that the majority of these loci were missed by GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a Mendelian form of encephalopathy. We also find pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections. TWMR better accounts for pleiotropy and has the potential to identify biological mechanisms underlying complex traits.},

  abstract = {Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The known determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy only partially explain its variability. The purpose of this study was to estimate heritability of left ventricular mass. The study sample included adults in the original Framingham Heart Study and the Framingham Offspring Study who were not receiving antihypertensive medications and who were free of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, valvular heart disease, and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass among first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, and unrelated spouse pairs were calculated to determine the contribution of heredity to the variability in left ventricular mass. After adjustments for age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure, the intraclass correlations between first-degree relatives were .15 (parent-child, P{$<$}.001) to .16 (siblings, P{$<$}.001), between second-degree relatives the correlation was .06 (P=NS), and between spouses it was .05 (P=NS). The estimated heritability of adjusted left ventricular mass was between .24 and .32. The proportion of the variance in sex-specific left ventricular mass explained by age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure was .26 in men and .34 in women. On the basis of intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass, incorporation of adjusted left ventricular mass of a parent or sibling would increase the explained variance by an additional .02 to .03. Heredity explains a small, but discernible proportion of the variance in left ventricular mass. Studies are currently under way to identify genetic markers that predict an individual's predisposition to left ventricular hypertrophy. This knowledge may lead to advances in the prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

Here, we introduce an sQTL mapping method, testing for heterogeneity between isoform-eQTL effects (THISTLE), with improved power over competing methods. Applying THISTLE together with a complementary sQTL mapping strategy to brain transcriptomic (n\,=\,2,865) and genotype data, we identified 12,794 genes with cis-sQTLs at P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8, approximately 61\% of which were distinct from eQTLs. Integrating the sQTL data into GWAS for 12 brain-related complex traits (including diseases), we identified 244 genes associated with the traits through cis-sQTLs, approximately 61\% of which could not be discovered using the corresponding eQTL data. Our study demonstrates the distinct role of most sQTLs in the genetic regulation of transcription and complex trait variation.},

  abstract = {Approximately half of patients with heart failure have preserved ejection fraction. There is no proven treatment that improves outcome. The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is complex and includes left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary vascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, and peripheral abnormalities. Multiple lines of evidence point to impaired nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP bioavailability as playing a central role in each of these abnormalities. In contrast to traditional organic nitrate therapies, an alternative strategy to restore NO-cGMP signaling is via inorganic nitrite. Inorganic nitrite, previously considered to be an inert byproduct of NO metabolism, functions as an important in vivo reservoir for NO generation, particularly under hypoxic and acidosis conditions. As such, inorganic nitrite becomes most active at times of greater need for NO signaling, as during exercise when left ventricular filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures increase. Herein, we present the rationale and design for the INDIE-HFpEF trial (Inorganic Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction), which is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study assessing the effect of inhaled inorganic nitrite on peak exercise capacity, conducted in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored Heart Failure Clinical Research Network.

Objective: To determine the effect of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with placebo on exercise capacity and clinical status in HFPEF. Design: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 216 stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction {$\geq$}50\%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity. Participants were randomized from October 2008 through February 2012 at 26 centers in North America. Follow-up was through August 30, 2012. Interventions: Sildenafil (n=113) or placebo (n=103) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Primary end point was change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included change in 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite clinical status score (range, 1-n, a higher value indicates better status; expected value with no treatment effect, 95) based on time to death, time to cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization, and change in quality of life for participants without cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization at 24 weeks. Results: Median age was 69 years, and 48\% of patients were women. At baseline, median peak oxygen consumption (11.7 mL/kg/min) and 6-minute walk distance (308 m) were reduced. The median E/e{$\prime$} (16), left atrial volume index (44 mL/m2), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (41 mm Hg) were consistent with chronically elevated left ventricular filling pressures. At 24 weeks, median (IQR) changes in peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) in patients who received placebo (-0.20 [IQR, -0.70 to 1.00]) or sildenafil (-0.20 [IQR, -1.70 to 1.11]) were not significantly different (P=.90) in analyses in which patients with missing week-24 data were excluded, and in sensitivity analysis based on intention to treat with multiple imputation for missing values (mean between-group difference, 0.01 mL/kg/min, [95\% CI, -0.60 to 0.61]). The mean clinical status rank score was not significantly different at 24 weeks between placebo (95.8) and sildenafil (94.2) (P=.85). Changes in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks in patients who received placebo (15.0 m [IQR, -26.0 to 45.0]) or sildenafil (5.0 m [IQR, -37.0 to 55.0]; P=.92) were also not significantly different. Adverse events occurred in 78 placebo patients (76\%) and 90 sildenafil patients (80\%). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 placebo patients (16\%) and 25 sildenafil patients (22\%). Conclusion and Relevance: Among patients with HFPEF, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with administration of sildenafil for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity or clinical status.

BACKGROUND Nitrates are commonly prescribed to enhance activity tolerance in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction. We compared the effect of isosorbide mononitrate or placebo on daily activity in such patients. METHODS In this multicenter, double-blind, crossover study, 110 patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction were randomly assigned to a 6-week dose-escalation regimen of isosorbide mononitrate (from 30 mg to 60 mg to 120 mg once daily) or placebo, with subsequent crossover to the other group for 6 weeks. The primary end point was the daily activity level, quantified as the average daily accelerometer units during the 120-mg phase, as assessed by patient-worn accelerometers. Secondary end points included hours of activity per day during the 120-mg phase, daily accelerometer units during all three dose regimens, quality-of-life scores, 6-minute walk distance, and levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). RESULTS In the group receiving the 120-mg dose of isosorbide mononitrate, as compared with the placebo group, there was a nonsignificant trend toward lower daily activity (-381 accelerometer units; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -780 to 17; P = 0.06) and a significant decrease in hours of activity per day (-0.30 hours; 95\% CI, -0.55 to -0.05; P = 0.02). During all dose regimens, activity in the isosorbide mononitrate group was lower than that in the placebo group (-439 accelerometer units; 95\% CI, -792 to -86; P = 0.02). Activity levels decreased progressively and significantly with increased doses of isosorbide mononitrate (but not placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in the 6-minute walk distance, quality-of-life scores, or NT-proBNP levels. CONCLUSIONS Patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction who received isosorbide mononitrate were less active and did not have better quality of life or submaximal exercise capacity than did patients who received placebo.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Studies in experimental and human heart failure suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors may enhance cardiovascular function and thus exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with placebo on exercise capacity and clinical status in HFPEF. DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 216 stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction {$\geq$}50\%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity. Participants were randomized from October 2008 through February 2012 at 26 centers in North America. Follow-up was through August 30, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Sildenafil (n = 113) or placebo (n = 103) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point was change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included change in 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite clinical status score (range, 1-n, a higher value indicates better status; expected value with no treatment effect, 95) based on time to death, time to cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization, and change in quality of life for participants without cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization at 24 weeks. RESULTS: Median age was 69 years, and 48\% of patients were women. At baseline, median peak oxygen consumption (11.7 mL/kg/min) and 6-minute walk distance (308 m) were reduced. The median E/e' (16), left atrial volume index (44 mL/m2), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (41 mm Hg) were consistent with chronically elevated left ventricular filling pressures. At 24 weeks, median (IQR) changes in peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) in patients who received placebo (-0.20 [IQR, -0.70 to 1.00]) or sildenafil (-0.20 [IQR, -1.70 to 1.11]) were not significantly different (P = .90) in analyses in which patients with missing week-24 data were excluded, and in sensitivity analysis based on intention to treat with multiple imputation for missing values (mean between-group difference, 0.01 mL/kg/min, [95\% CI, -0.60 to 0.61]). The mean clinical status rank score was not significantly different at 24 weeks between placebo (95.8) and sildenafil (94.2) (P = .85). Changes in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks in patients who received placebo (15.0 m [IQR, -26.0 to 45.0]) or sildenafil (5.0 m [IQR, -37.0 to 55.0]; P = .92) were also not significantly different. Adverse events occurred in 78 placebo patients (76\%) and 90 sildenafil patients (80\%). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 placebo patients (16\%) and 25 sildenafil patients (22\%). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with HFPEF, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with administration of sildenafil for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity or clinical status.

ACE2 is a newly identified member of this system, which converts angiotensin II to angiotensin, and of which the occurrence in plasma has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the heritability of circulating ACE, ACE2, and neprilysin (NEP), which may also be a regulator of BP, in a family study, and to determine covariates that contribute to the variation in plasma activity. ACE, ACE2, and NEP activities were measured in plasma from 534 subjects in the Leeds Family Study using selective fluorogenic substrates. Genetic factors accounted for 24.5\%, 67\%, and 22.7\% of the phenotypic variation in circulating ACE, ACE2, and NEP, respectively. ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism and other measured covariates accounted for 23.8\% of variance in circulating ACE. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was a significant determinant of circulating ACE2. Measured covariates accounted for 17.3\% of variation in circulating NEP. ACE and NEP were associated with systolic and diastolic BP in univariate analyses; however, only ACE was independently associated with systolic and diastolic BP after accounting for covariates and shared childhood household.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, uncertainty regarding kidney outcomes persists and whether benefits extend to exendin-4-based GLP-1 receptor remains uncertain. We aimed to meta-analyse the most up-to-date evidence on the cardiovascular benefits and risks of GLP-1 receptor agonists from outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis, including new data from AMPLITUDE-O, using a random effects model to estimate overall hazard ratio (HR) for MACE; its components; all-cause mortality; hospital admission for heart failure; a composite kidney outcome consisting of development of macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, or at least 40\% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), kidney replacement therapy, or death due to kidney disease; worsening of kidney function, based on eGFR change; and odds ratios for key safety outcomes (severe hypoglycaemia, retinopathy, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer). We also examined MACE outcome in patient subgroups on the basis of MACE incidence rates in the placebo group, presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, HbA1c level, trial duration, treatment dosing interval, structural homology to human GLP-1 or exendin-4, BMI, age, and eGFR. We searched PubMed for eligible trials reporting MACE (ie, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke), up to June 9, 2021. We meta-analysed data from published randomised placebo-controlled trials testing either injectable or oral GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. We restricted the search to trials of more than 500 patients with a primary outcome that included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. This meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO, CRD42021259711. FINDINGS: Of 98 articles screened, eight trials comprising 60\,080 patients fulfilled the prespecified criteria and were included. Overall, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced MACE by 14\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}86 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}80-0{$\cdot$}93]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), with no significant heterogeneity across GLP-1 receptor agonist structural homology or eight other examined subgroups (all pinteraction{$\geq$}0{$\cdot$}14). GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced all-cause mortality by 12\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}88 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}82-0{$\cdot$}94]; p=0{$\cdot$}0001), hospital admission for heart failure by 11\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}89 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}82-0{$\cdot$}98]; p=0{$\cdot$}013), and the composite kidney outcome by 21\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}79 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}73-0{$\cdot$}87]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), with no increase in risk of severe hypoglycaemia, retinopathy, or pancreatic adverse effects. In sensitivity analyses removing the only trial restricted to patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ELIXA), all benefits marginally increased, including the outcome of worsening of kidney function, based on eGFR change (HR 0{$\cdot$}82 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}69-0{$\cdot$}98]; p=0{$\cdot$}030). INTERPRETATION: GLP-1 receptor agonists, regardless of structural homology, reduced the risk of individual MACE components, all-cause mortality, hospital admission for heart failure, and worsening kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes. FUNDING: None.},

However, causal inference is undermined if genetic variants used to instrument a risk factor also influence alternative disease-pathways (horizontal pleiotropy). Here we report how the `no horizontal pleiotropy assumption' is strengthened when proteins are the risk factors of interest. Proteins are typically the proximal effectors of biological processes encoded in the genome. Moreover, proteins are the targets of most medicines, so MR studies of drug targets are becoming a fundamental tool in drug development. To enable such studies, we introduce a mathematical framework that contrasts MR analysis of proteins with that of risk factors located more distally in the causal chain from gene to disease. We illustrate key model decisions and introduce an analytical framework for maximising power and evaluating the robustness of analyses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:In observational analyses, higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease events. However, whether raising HDL cholesterol levels therapeutically reduces cardiovascular risk remains uncertain. Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) raises HDL cholesterol levels and might therefore improve cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS:We randomly assigned 15,871 patients who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome to receive the CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib, at a dose of 600 mg daily, or placebo, in addition to the best available evidence-based care. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, unstable angina, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. RESULTS:At the time of randomization, the mean HDL cholesterol level was 42 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter), and the mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was 76 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter). Over the course of the trial, HDL cholesterol levels increased from baseline by 4 to 11\% in the placebo group and by 31 to 40\% in the dalcetrapib group. Dalcetrapib had a minimal effect on LDL cholesterol levels. Patients were followed for a median of 31 months. At a prespecified interim analysis that included 1135 primary end-point events (71\% of the projected total number), the independent data and safety monitoring board recommended termination of the trial for futility. As compared with placebo, dalcetrapib did not alter the risk of the primary end point (cumulative event rate, 8.0\% and 8.3\%, respectively; hazard ratio with dalcetrapib, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.16; P = 0.52) and did not have a significant effect on any component of the primary end point or total mortality. The median C-reactive protein level was 0.2 mg per liter higher and the mean systolic blood pressure was 0.6 mm Hg higher with dalcetrapib as compared with placebo (P{\textexclamdown}0.001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS:In patients who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome, dalcetrapib increased HDL cholesterol levels but did not reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. (Funded by F.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although genetic factors contribute to the onset of heart failure (HF), no large-scale genome-wide investigation of HF risk has been published to date. We have investigated the association of 2,478,304 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with incident HF by meta-analyzing data from 4 community-based prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eligible participants for these analyses were of European or African ancestry and free of clinical HF at baseline. Each study independently conducted genome-wide scans and imputed data to the approximately 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HapMap. Within each study, Cox proportional hazards regression models provided age- and sex-adjusted estimates of the association between each variant and time to incident HF. Fixed-effect meta-analyses combined results for each single-nucleotide polymorphism from the 4 cohorts to produce an overall association estimate and P value. A genome-wide significance P value threshold was set a priori at 5.0x10(-7). During a mean follow-up of 11.5 years, 2526 incident HF events (12\%) occurred in 20 926 European-ancestry participants. The meta-analysis identified a genome-wide significant locus at chromosomal position 15q22 (1.4x10(-8)), which was 58.8 kb from USP3. Among 2895 African-ancestry participants, 466 incident HF events (16\%) occurred during a mean follow-up of 13.7 years. One genome-wide significant locus was identified at 12q14 (6.7x10(-8)), which was 6.3 kb from LRIG3. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 2 loci that were associated with incident HF and exceeded genome-wide significance. The findings merit replication in other community-based settings of incident HF.},

  abstract = {Aims: The relation between non-cardiac comorbidities and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with heart failure (HF) has been studied to a limited extent. To investigate the HRQoL and their determinants among HF patients with and without comorbidities. Methods and results: TRIUMPH (TRanslational Initiative on Unique and novel strategies for Management of Patients with Heart failure) is a Dutch prospective, multicentre study enrolling 496 acute HF patients between 2009 and 2014. We included 334 patients who had completed the HRQoL questionnaires at baseline. The HRQoL was measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) en EuroQuality-of-life five Dimensions (EQ-5D). Comorbidity was defined as having a history of at least one of the following comorbidities: chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and/or cerebrovascular accident. Patients with comorbidity (n = 205, 61\%) had lower scores on the physical limitation scale and clinical summary score of the KCCQ (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively). Female sex, COPD, previous HF, increasing body mass index (BMI), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high systolic blood pressure, and the presence of anxiety and/or depression negatively influenced the HRQoL among HF patients with comorbidity. Besides anxiety and depression, we hardly found any other determinant of HRQoL in patients without comorbidity. Conclusion: Heart failure patients without comorbidity had better HRQoL than patients with comorbidity. Sex, previous HF, BMI, COPD, systolic blood pressure, NT-proBNP levels, and also anxiety and depression were determinants of HRQoL in patients with comorbidity. In those without comorbidity, apart from anxiety and depression, no further determinants of HRQoL were found.},

We ascertained 56 male and 80 female adult same-sex twin pairs from the Flemish population. Plasma renin activity (PRA), the concentration of angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were measured, and path analysis was applied, after transformation toward normality. For PRA and AGT significant heritability was only detected in the male subgroup, with heritability estimates of 66\% and 90\%, respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme concentration was determined by additive genes for 43\% of its variance, by shared environmental influences for 42\%, and by specific environmental influences for 15\%. The high heritability found for AGT is compatible with the results of earlier studies linking the M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene to plasma AGT levels. For PRA, we are the first to show significant heritability. Our results regarding ACE confirm the findings in other populations.},

  abstract = {Aims: Despite major improvements in pharmacological and device treatments, heart failure remains a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality, poor quality of life, and high health-care costs. Given the extensive heterogeneity among patients with heart failure, substantial differences in the response to therapy can be expected. We hypothesize that individualized therapy is an essential next step to improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. Methods: The BIOlogy Study to TAilored Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure (BIOSTAT-CHF) included 2516 patients with worsening signs and/or symptoms of heart failure from 11 European countries, who were considered to be on suboptimal medical treatment. Another 1738 patients from Scotland were included in a validation cohort. Overall, both patient cohorts were well matched. The majority of patients were hospitalized for acute heart failure, and the remainder presented with worsening signs and/or symptoms of heart failure at outpatient clinics. Approximately half of the patients were in New York Heart Association class III, and 7\% vs 34\% of patients of the index vs validation cohort had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. According to study design, all patients used diuretics, but owing to the inclusion criteria of both cohorts, patients were not on optimal, evidence-based medical therapy. In the follow-up phase, uptitration to guideline-recommended doses was encouraged. Conclusion: By using a novel systems biology approach, incorporating demographics, biomarkers, genome-wide analysis, and proteomics, a model that predicts response to therapy will be developed, which should be instrumental in developing alternative therapies for patients with suboptimal response to currently recommended therapies and thus further improve care for patients with heart failure.},

  abstract = {Objective: We sought to assess the effects on cerebrovascular events of treating patients with stable coronary disease with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels substantially below 100 mg/dl. Background: Lowering LDL-C with statins has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with stable coronary disease. In observational studies, naturally low cholesterol levels have been associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The cerebrovascular benefits of treating patients with stable coronary disease to LDL-C levels substantially below 100 mg/dl have not been previously investigated. Methods: We describe an analysis of cerebrovascular events in the Treating to New Targets study, a trial where 10,001 patients with documented coronary disease were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin at 10 mg/day or 80 mg/day and followed for a median of 4.9 years. Results: Mean LDL-C levels were 101 mg/dl on 10 mg atorvastatin and 77 mg/dl on 80 mg. In addition to the reduction in major cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 0.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.69 to 0.89; p = 0.0002), the primary end point of the trial, patients in the 80-mg arm experienced a reduction in cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio 0.77, 95\% CI 0.64 to 0.93; p = 0.007) and stroke (hazard ratio 0.75, 95\% CI 0.59 to 0.96; p = 0.02). Each 1-mg/dl reduction in LDL-C with treatment was associated with a 0.6\% relative risk reduction in cerebrovascular events (p = 0.002) and a 0.5\% relative risk reduction in stroke (p = 0.041). The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was similar in the 80-mg and 10-mg groups, 16 and 18 respectively, and the hemorrhagic strokes were distributed evenly across quintiles of achieved LDL-C during treatment. Conclusions: Among patients with established coronary disease, treating to an LDL-cholesterol substantially below 100 mg/dl with 80 mg/day atorvastatin reduces both stroke and cerebrovascular events by an additional 20\% to 25\% compared with the 10 mg/day dose. An increase in hemorrhagic stroke was not seen at low LDL-C levels.

  abstract = {for the TNT Steering Committee Members and Investigators The Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial is a parallel-group study that has randomized 10,003 patients from 14 countries to double-blind treatment with either ator-vastatin 10 or 80 mg. During the double-blind period, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are expected to reach approximate mean values of 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L) for the low-dose atorvastatin group and 75 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/L) for the high-dose group. Ran-domized patients are expected to be followed for an average of 5 years. The primary end point is the time to occurrence of a major cardiovascular event, defined as coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial in-farction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke. The large patient numbers in the TNT study and long follow-up should ensure that there is adequate power to definitively determine if reducing LDL cholesterol levels to approximately 75 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/L) can provide additional clinical benefit. 2004 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

  abstract = {Most complex human traits differ by sex, but we have limited insight into the underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigated the influence of biological sex on protein expression and its genetic regulation in 1,277 human brain proteomes. We found that 13.2\% (1,354) of brain proteins had sex-differentiated abundance and 1.5\% (150) of proteins had sex-biased protein quantitative trait loci (sb-pQTLs). Among genes with sex-biased expression, we found 67\% concordance between sex-differentiated protein and transcript levels; however, sex effects on the genetic regulation of expression were more evident at the protein level. Considering 24 psychiatric, neurologic and brain morphologic traits, we found that an average of 25\% of their putatively causal genes had sex-differentiated protein abundance and 12 putatively causal proteins had sb-pQTLs. Furthermore, integrating sex-specific pQTLs with sex-stratified genome-wide association studies of six psychiatric and neurologic conditions, we uncovered another 23 proteins contributing to these traits in one sex but not the other. Together, these findings begin to provide insights into mechanisms underlying sex differences in brain protein expression and disease.},

This protocol provides guidelines for (i) organizational aspects of GWAMAs, and for (ii) QC at the study file level, the meta-level across studies and the meta-analysis output level. Real-world examples highlight issues experienced and solutions developed by the GIANT Consortium that has conducted meta-analyses including data from 125 studies comprising more than 330,000 individuals. We provide a general protocol for conducting GWAMAs and carrying out QC to minimize errors and to guarantee maximum use of the data. We also include details for the use of a powerful and flexible software package called EasyQC. Precise timings will be greatly influenced by consortium size. For consortia of comparable size to the GIANT Consortium, this protocol takes a minimum of about 10 months to complete.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative nervous system disease. At present, there are certain limitations in various treatment options aimed at preventing or delaying the progression of PD. Therefore, the exploration of new drugs for PD is beneficial. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis can be used to explore the association between drugs and diseases. In this study, MR analysis was adopted to investigate the causal relationship between 23 drugs and PD. These drugs have been approved for the treatment of different diseases, such as salicylic acid and derivatives (collectively called salicylates, e.g., aspirin, used for fever and pain relief), antithrombotic agents (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, used for preventing thrombotic events). METHODS: The GWAS data for the 23 drugs were obtained from the UK Biobank (UKB) project, while the GWAS data for PD were sourced from FinnGen. Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs). We first performed a series of quality control steps (including MR-PRESSO) to select the appropriate SNPs. Two-sample MR analysis was performed using five different methods, including inverse variance weighting (IVW) with random-effects model, weighted median, MR-Egger, simple model, and weighted model. At the same time, sensitivity analysis was carried out using the MR-Egger and Cochran's Q test to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the results. RESULTS: In MR-PRESSO, salicylates and antithrombotic agents showed statistically significant associations with PD, respectively. In the main MR analysis (IVW), there was a negative causal relationship between salicylates and PD (OR~=~0.73, 95\% CI~=~0.54-0.98, p~=~.039). Similarly, there was a negative causal relationship between antithrombotic agents and PD (OR~=~0.70, 95\%CI~=~0.52-0.96, p~=~.027). No statistically significant association was found between the remaining 21 drugs and PD. CONCLUSION: This MR study demonstrated that salicylates and antithrombotic agents can reduce the risk of PD, thus providing a novel avenue for future drug exploration in PD.},

Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in {$\sim$}450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N~{$\sim$}700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P~{$<~$}1~{\texttimes}~10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain {$\sim$}24.6\% of the variance of height and {$\sim$}6.0\% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were {$\sim$}0.44 and {$\sim$}0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow-up studies.},

  abstract = {Background-Patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (CHF) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have a high risk of death and hospitalization for CHF deterioration despite therapies with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, {$\beta$}-blockers, and even an aldosterone antagonist. To determine whether the angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan decreases cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, and all-cause mortality in patients with CHF and depressed LVEF, a prespecified analysis of the combined Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) low LVEF trials was performed. CHARM is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international trial program. Methods and Results-New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II through IV CHF patients with an LVEF of {$\leq$}40\% were randomized to candesartan or placebo in 2 complementary parallel trials (CHARM-Alternative, for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors, and CHARM-Added, for patients who were receiving ACE inhibitors). Mortality and morbidity were determined in 4576 low LVEF patients (2289 candesartan and 2287 placebo), titrated as tolerated to a target dose of 32 mg once daily, and observed for 2 to 4 years (median, 40 months). The primary outcome (time to first event by intention to treat) was cardiovascular death or CHF hospitalization for each trial, with all-cause mortality a secondary end point in the pooled analysis of the low LVEF trials. Of the patients in the candesartan group, 817 (35.7\%) experienced cardiovascular death or a CHF hospitalization as compared with 944 (41.3\%) in the placebo group (HR 0.82; 95\% CI 0.74 to 0.90; P{\textexclamdown}0.001) with reduced risk for both cardiovascular deaths (521 [22.8\%] versus 599 [26.2\%]; HR 0.84 [95\% CI 0.75 to 0.95]; P=0.005) and CHF hospitalizations (516 [22.5\%] versus 642 [28.1\%]; HR 0.76 [95\% CI 0.68 to 0.85]; P{\textexclamdown}0.001). It is important to note that all-cause mortality also was significantly reduced by candesartan (642 [28.0\%] versus 708 [31.0\%]; HR 0.88 [95\% CI 0.79 to 0.98]; P=0.018). No significant heterogeneity for the beneficial effects of candesartan was found across prespecified and subsequently identified subgroups including treatment with ACE inhibitors, {$\beta$}-blockers, an aldosterone antagonist, or their combinations. The study drug was discontinued because of adverse effects by 23.1\% of patients in the candesartan group and 18.8\% in the placebo group; the reasons included increased creatinine (7.1\% versus 3.5\%), hypotension (4.2\% versus 2.1\%), and hyperkalemia (2.8\% versus 0.5\%), respectively (all P{\textexclamdown}0.001). Conclusion-Candesartan significantly reduces all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with CHF and LVEF s40\% when added to standard therapies including ACE inhibitors, {$\beta$}-blockers, and an aldosterone antagonist. Routine monitoring of blood pressure, serum creatinine, and serum potassium is warranted.},

In previous studies of patients with CHF and low LVEF or vascular disease and preserved LVEF, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is beneficial. We investigated the effect of addition of an angiotensin-receptor blocker to current treatments. Methods: Between March, 1999, and July, 2000, we randomly assigned 3023 patients candesartan (n=1514, target dose 32 mg once daily) or matching placebo (n=1509). Patients had New York Heart Association functional class II-IV CHF and LVEF higher than 40\%. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or admission to hospital for CHF. Anaysis was done by intention to treat. Findings: Median follow-up was 36. 6 months. 333 (22\%) patients in the candesartan and 366 (24\%) in the placebo group experienced the primary outcome (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.89 [95\% CI 0.77-1.03], p=0.118; covariate adjusted 0.86 [0.74-1.0], p=0.051). Cardiovascular death did not differ between groups (170 vs 170), but fewer patients in the candesartan group than in the placebo group were admitted to hospital for CHF once (230 vs 279, p=0.017) or multiple times. Composite outcomes that included non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke showed similar results to the primary composite (388 vs 429; unadjusted 0.88 [0.77-1.01], p=0.078; covariate adjusted 0.86 [0.75-0.99], p=0.037).

  abstract = {Objective Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce serum urate, but their efficacy depends on renal function which is often impaired in people with gout. SGLT1 is primarily expressed in the small intestine and its inhibition may be a more suitable therapeutic target. We aimed to investigate the association of genetically proxied SGLT1i with gout risk, serum urate levels and cardiovascular safety using Mendelian randomisation (MR). Methods Leveraging data from a genome-wide association study of 344,182 individuals in the UK Biobank, we identified a missense variant in the SLC5A1 gene that associated with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) to proxy SGLT1i. Outcome genetic data comprised 13,179 gout cases and 750,634 controls, 457,690 individuals for serum urate levels, and up to 977,323 individuals for cardiovascular safety outcomes. We applied the Wald ratio method and investigated potential genetic confounding using colocalization. Results The rs17683430 missense variant was selected to instrument SGLT1i. Genetically proxied SGLT1i was associated with 75\% reduction in gout risk (OR 0.25; 95\%CI 0.06, 0.99; p~=~0.048) and 32.0~{$\mu$}mol/L reduction in serum urate (95\%CI -56.7, -7.3; p~=~0.01), per 6.7~mmol/mol reduction in HbA1c. SGLT1i was associated with increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.37~mmol/L; 95\%CI 0.17, 0.56; p~=~0.0002) but not risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, or chronic kidney disease. Colocalization did not suggest that results are attributable to genetic confounding. Conclusion SGLT1 inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic option for preventing gout in people with or without comorbid diabetes. Randomised trials are needed to formally investigate efficacy and safety.},
