  abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity at genomic loci encoding drug targets can be exploited by multivariable Mendelian randomization to provide insight on the pathways by which pharmacological interventions may affect disease risk. However, statistical inference in such investigations may be poor if overdispersion heterogeneity in measured genetic associations is unaccounted for. In this work, we first develop conditional F-statistics for dimension-reduced genetic associations that enable more accurate measurement of phenotypic heterogeneity. We then develop a novel extension for two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization that accounts for overdispersion heterogeneity in dimension-reduced genetic associations. Our empirical focus is to use genetic variants in the GLP1R gene region to understand the mechanism by which GLP1R agonism affects coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Colocalization analyses indicate that distinct variants in the GLP1R gene region are associated with body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses that were corrected for overdispersion heterogeneity suggest that bodyweight lowering rather than type 2 diabetes liability lowering effects of GLP1R agonism are more likely contributing to reduced CAD risk. Tissue-specific analyses prioritised brain tissue as the most likely to be relevant for CAD risk, of the tissues considered. We hope the multivariable Mendelian randomization approach illustrated here is widely applicable to better understand mechanisms linking drug targets to diseases outcomes, and hence to guide drug development efforts.},
