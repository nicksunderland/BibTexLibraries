  abstract = {Heart failure with a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) is common in obesity and coronary artery disease (CAD). Both ischemia and reperfusion induce leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) gene expression. We aimed to investigate the possible associations of serum leptin, leptin gene and leptin receptor gene polymorphism with HFNEF in patients with CAD. 100 Egyptian CAD patients with HFNEF and 100 healthy subjects (the control group) were genotyped for LEP and LEPR polymorphism. Leptin levels were measured. Serum leptin levels were significantly increased in patients compared to the control group. There was a significant increase in the leptin gene (AA genotype) and the leptin receptor gene (RR genotype) in HFNEF patients compared to the control group. Leptin levels, leptin gene (AA genotype) and LEPR (RR genotype) were more associated with NYHA III than with NYHA I and II. We thus concluded that HFNEF is associated with increased serum leptin levels, and the LEP AA genotype or LEPR RR genotype carries at least a threefold increased risk of developing HFNEF.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature regarding the familial heritability of heart failure and to discuss the possible mechanisms through which this risk is mediated. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from the Framingham Heart Study recently showed that the parental occurrence of heart failure increases the risk of heart failure in offspring. Although the mechanisms mediating this increased risk are not elucidated, heritable risks of heart failure may result from genes affecting the cardiac or vascular systems. Alternatively, familial risk may be mediated partly through the inheritance of recognized or as yet unidentified risk factors for heart failure. Heritable components or genetic loci for quantitative traits contribute to the development of hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, valvular heart disease, and metabolic conditions, which collectively increase the risk of heart failure. SUMMARY: A careful assessment of the family history of heart failure and associated risk factors may identify treatable targets that can potentially reduce the likelihood of developing heart failure, and can assist in the implementation of preventive strategies for risk populations with stages A and B heart failure.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To characterize the individual-level agreement of CHD PRSs that perform similarly at the population level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study of participants from diverse backgrounds enrolled in the All of Us Research Program (AOU), Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) ATLAS Precision Health Biobank with electronic health record and genotyping data. EXPOSURES Polygenic risk for CHD from published PRSs and new PRSs developed separately from testing samples. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES PRSs that performed population-level prediction similarly were identified by comparing calibration and discrimination of models of prevalent CHD. Individual-level agreement was tested with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Light {$\kappa$}. RESULTS A total of 48 PRSs were calculated for 171 095 AOU participants. The mean (SD) age was 56.4 (16.8) years. A total of 104 947 participants (61.3\%) were female. A total of 35 590 participants (20.8\%) were most genetically similar to an African reference population, 29 801 (17.4\%) to an admixed American reference population, 100 493 (58.7\%) to a European reference population, and the remaining to Central/South Asian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern reference populations. There were 17 589 participants (10.3\%) with and 153 506 participants without (89.7\%) CHD. When included in a model of prevalent CHD, 46 scores had practically equivalent Brier scores and area under the receiver operator curves (region of practical equivalence {\textpm}0.02). Twenty percent of participants had at least 1 score in both the top and bottom 5\% of risk. Continuous agreement of individual predictions was poor (ICC, 0.373 [95\% CI, 0.372-0.375]). Light {$\kappa$}, used to evaluate consistency of risk assignment, did not exceed 0.56. Analysis among 41 193 PMBB and 53 092 ATLAS participants yielded different sets of equivalent scores, which also lacked individual-level agreement. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE CHD PRSs that performed similarly at the population level demonstrated highly variable individual-level estimates of risk. Recognizing that CHD PRSs may generate incongruent individual-level risk estimates, effective clinical implementation will require refined statistical methods to quantify uncertainty and new strategies to communicate this uncertainty to patients and clinicians.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Observational data provide compelling evidence for elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) as a risk factor for heart failure (HF), particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Given the limitations of observational studies, uncertainties persist regarding the causal role of FGF23 in the pathogenesis of HF and HFpEF. Recently, Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have been performed to examine causal associations between FGF23 and HF phenotypes. RECENT FINDINGS: The current review describes the methodological basis of the MR techniques used to examine the causal role of FGF23 on HF phenotypes, highlighting the importance of large-scale multiomics data. The findings from most of the MR studies indicate an absence of evidence of a causal effect of FGF23 on the risk of HF in general population settings. However, analysis using individual-level data showed a strong association between genetically-predicted FGF23 and HFpEF in individuals with a genetic predisposition to low estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR). SUMMARY: Evidence from MR analysis suggests a causal role of FGF23 in the pathogenesis of HFpEF in low eGFR settings - a finding supported by experimental, clinical, and epidemiological data. While future MR studies of FGF23 and HFpEF could provide further evidence, randomized trials of FGF23-lowering agents could provide the most definitive answers on the association in chronic kidney disease populations.},

It is costly, predisposes to many cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD), is increasing at an alarming rate, and disproportionately affects people of low-socioeconomic status. It has a myriad of deleterious effects on the body, particularly on the CV system. Obesity is a major risk factor for heart failure (HF) and highly prevalent in this population, particularly in those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), to the extent that an obesity HFpEF phenotype has been proposed in the literature. However, once HF is developed, an obesity paradox exists where those with obesity have better short- and mid-term survival than normal or underweight individuals, despite a greater risk for hospitalizations. It may be argued that excess energy reserve, younger patient population, higher tolerability of HF therapy and better nutritional status may account for at least part of the obesity paradox on survival. Furthermore, body mass index (BMI) may not be an accurate measure of body composition, especially in HF, where there is an excess volume status. BMI also fails to delineate fat-free mass and its components, which is a better predictor of functional capacity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), which particularly is increasingly being recognized as a risk modifier in both healthy individuals and in persons with comorbidities, particularly in HF. Notably, when CRF is accounted for, the obesity paradox disappears, suggesting that improving CRF might represent a therapeutic target with greater importance than changes in body weight in the setting of HF.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Prospective cohort studies typically observe U- or J-shaped relationships between body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) and mortality. However, some studies suggest that the elevated mortality at lower BMIs is due to confounding by pre-existing occult disease and recommend eliminating subjects who die during the first several (k) years of follow-up. This meta-analysis tests the effects of such early death exclusion on the BMI-mortality association. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Studies identified from MEDLINE, review articles, ancestry analyses, and the "invisible college." INCLUDED STUDIES: 1) measured relative body weight at baseline; 2) included at least 1000 subjects; 3) reported results with and without early-death exclusion, or relevant data; and 4) did not study exclusively diseased populations. Blank tables were mailed to 131 investigators covering 59 databases. Completed tables (n = 16 databases), electronic raw data (n = 7 databases), and original articles (n = 6 databases) provided final data. Meta-analytic regressions compared the BMI-mortality association with and without early death exclusion. The sample included 29 studies and 1,954,345 subjects. RESULTS: The effect of eliminating early deaths was statistically significant but minuscule in magnitude. Implementation of early death exclusion was estimated to shift the BMI associated with minimum mortality only 0.4 units for men and 0.6 units for women at age 50. Even at a BMI 16, the estimated relative risk (compared to BMI 25) decreased only 0.008 units for men and 0.076 units for women at age 50. DISCUSSION: Results indicate that either pre-existing disease does not confound the BMI-mortality association or eliminating early deaths is inefficient for reducing that confounding.},

Several novel treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes (T2D) mimic GLP-1 actions or inhibit incretin degradation (DPP4 inhibitors), but none is thus far aimed at increasing the secretion of endogenous incretins. In order to identify new potential therapeutic targets for treatment of T2D, we performed a meta-analysis of a GWAS and an exome-wide association study of circulating insulin, glucagon, GIP, and GLP-1 concentrations measured during an oral glucose tolerance test in up to 7,828 individuals. We identified 6 genome-wide significant functional loci associated with plasma incretin concentrations in or near the SLC5A1 (encoding SGLT1), GIPR, ABO, GLP2R, F13A1, and HOXD1 genes and studied the effect of these variants on mRNA expression in pancreatic islet and on metabolic phenotypes. Immunohistochemistry showed expression of GIPR, ABO, and HOXD1 in human enteroendocrine cells and expression of ABO in pancreatic islets, supporting a role in hormone secretion. This study thus provides candidate genes and insight into mechanisms by which secretion and breakdown of GIP and GLP-1 are regulated., GWAS of circulating fasting and glucose-stimulated concentrations of incretins GIP and GLP-1 identifies new genetic loci involved in hormone secretion and metabolism},

  abstract = {Obesity, particularly severe obesity is capable of producing hemodynamic alterations that contribute to changes in cardiac morphology which may predispose to impairment of ventricular function and heart failure. These include a high cardiac output state in most, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and LV diastolic dysfunction. Right heart involvement may result from LV failure, the hypercirculatory state, and sleep disordered breathing. In recent years experimental studies and some studies in humans suggest that certain neurohormonal and metabolic alterations that occur commonly in obesity may contribute to alterations in cardiac structure and function. These include activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, hyperleptinemia due to leptin resistance, low circulating adiponectin levels, insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia, and possibly cardiac lipotoxicity. This review will describe the ways in which these factors weave together to promote adaptations and maladaptations that result in alterations in cardiac structure and function which may contribute to the development of heart failure.},

Here we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) comprising 181,522 cases among 1,165,690 participants of predominantly European ancestry. We detected 241 associations, including 30 new loci. Cross-ancestry meta-analysis with a Japanese GWAS yielded 38 additional new loci. We prioritized likely causal variants using functionally informed fine-mapping, yielding 42 associations with less than five variants in the 95\% credible set. Similarity-based clustering suggested roles for early developmental processes, cell cycle signaling and vascular cell migration and proliferation in the pathogenesis of CAD. We prioritized 220 candidate causal genes, combining eight complementary approaches, including 123 supported by three or more approaches. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we experimentally validated the effect of an enhancer in MYO9B, which appears to mediate CAD risk by regulating vascular cell motility. Our analysis identifies and systematically characterizes {$>$}250 risk loci for CAD to inform experimental interrogation of putative causal mechanisms for CAD.},

With growing knowledge of the genetic basis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease---in particular, coronary artery disease---and its contribution to disease pathogenesis, there is increased interest in understanding the potential clinical utility of a genetic predictor that might further refine the assessment and management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Rapid scientific and technological advances have enabled widespread genotyping efforts and dynamic research in the field of coronary artery disease genetic risk prediction. In this review, we describe how genomic analyses of coronary artery disease have been leveraged to create polygenic risk scores. We then discuss evaluations of the clinical utility of these scores, pertinent mechanistic insights gleaned, and practical considerations relevant to the implementation of polygenic risk scores in the health care setting.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To ascertain in obesity the role of body fat distribution (the strongest predictor of morbility and mortality in obese subjects) in determining the degree of endothelial dysfunction, an early marker of atherosclerotic disease. SUBJECTS: 18 premenopausal women with uncomplicated obesity excluding other cardiovascular risk factors and 12 age-matched slim healthy women. MEASUREMENTS: Endothelium-dependent vasodilation, studied as diameter variation in response to an increase in shear-stress, was evaluated in the right common femoral artery of obese and slim subjects by a non invasive approach and compared to glyceril-trinitrate vasodilation. To characterize better the vascular functional and/or structural properties, we studied the arterial wall distensibility by an echo-tracking system. Adipose tissue regional distribution was determined by computerised axial tomography. RESULTS: The endothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly impaired in obese subjects (P{$<$}0.005 versus non-obese subjects) while glyceril-trinitrate vasodilation and arterial distensibility were similar in the two groups. In our obese subjects endothelial-dependent vasodilation was inversely correlated to body fat distribution (visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio: r=- 0. 624, P=0.0058). In contrast, metabolic parameters (except C-peptide response during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): r=-0.587, P=0. 01), blood pressure values and body weight did not correlate with the endothelial function. CONCLUSION: Uncomplicated obesity per se is characterised by an alteration of the endothelial function; the degree of this vascular damage is predicted by body fat distribution independently of body weight and metabolic and other haemodynamic parameters, and correlates with an index of insulin secretion.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic impacts of noncardiac comorbidities in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) compared with those with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of information on the comparative prognostic significance of comorbidities between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF. METHODS: In a national ambulatory cohort of veterans with HF, the comorbidity burden of 15 noncardiac comorbidities and the impacts of these comorbidities on hospitalization and mortality were compared between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 2,843 patients with HFpEF and 6,599 with HFrEF with 2-year follow-up. Compared with patients with HFrEF, those with HFpEF were older and had higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, psychiatric disorders, anemia, obesity, peptic ulcer disease, and cancer but a lower prevalence of chronic kidney disease. Patients with HFpEF had lower HF hospitalization, higher non-HF hospitalization, and similar overall hospitalization compared with those with HFrEF (p {$<$} 0.001, p {$<$} 0.001, and p = 0.19, respectively). An Increasing number of noncardiac comorbidities was associated with a higher risk for all-cause admissions (p {$<$} 0.001). Comorbidities had similar impacts on mortality in patients with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF, except for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which was associated with a higher hazard (1.62 [95\% confidence interval: 1.36 to 1.92] vs. 1.23 [95\% confidence interval: 1.11 to 1.37], respectively, p = 0.01 for interaction) in patients with HFpEF. CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher noncardiac comorbidity burden associated with higher non-HF hospitalizations in patients with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF. However, individually, most comorbidities have similar impacts on mortality in both groups. Aggressive management of comorbidities may have an overall greater prognostic impact in HFpEF compared to HFrEF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and can also have kidney benefits. However, whether GLP-1 receptor agonists improve clinically important kidney outcomes remains uncertain. We aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: For this meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials that included at least 500 participants with type 2 diabetes, compared a GLP-1 receptor agonist with placebo with at least 12 months of follow-up, and reported a primary clinical kidney or cardiovascular outcome, from database inception to March 26, 2024. Post hoc, we included the SELECT trial (NCT03574597), which enrolled participants with cardiovascular disease and a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or more without diabetes. Study-level summary data were extracted independently by two authors for inclusion in this random-effects analysis. The main kidney outcome was a composite outcome, consisting of kidney failure (kidney replacement therapy or a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] {$<$}15 mL/min per 1{$\cdot$}73 m2), a sustained reduction in eGFR by at least 50\% or the nearest equivalent, or death from kidney failure. The main cardiovascular outcome was MACE, consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024528864. FINDINGS: Of the 5140 records identified through the literature search, 11 trials, involving 85\,373 participants (29\,386 female, 55\,987 male), were included in the meta-analysis. In participants with type 2 diabetes (67\,769), GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced the composite kidney outcome by 18\% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}82, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}73-0{$\cdot$}93; I2 =26{$\cdot$}41\%), kidney failure by 16\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}84, 0{$\cdot$}72-0{$\cdot$}99; I2 =0\%), MACE by 13\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}87, 0{$\cdot$}81-0{$\cdot$}93; I2 =49{$\cdot$}75\%), and all-cause death by 12\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}88, 0{$\cdot$}83-0{$\cdot$}93; I2 =0\%). The effect on the composite kidney outcome (HR 0{$\cdot$}81, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}72-0{$\cdot$}92; I2 =23{$\cdot$}11\%), kidney failure (HR 0{$\cdot$}84, 0{$\cdot$}72-0{$\cdot$}98; I2 =0\%), MACE (HR 0{$\cdot$}86, 0{$\cdot$}80-0{$\cdot$}92; I2 =48{$\cdot$}9\%), and all-cause death (HR 0{$\cdot$}87, 0{$\cdot$}82-0{$\cdot$}91; I2 =0\%) was similar when the SELECT trial was included, with no evidence of heterogeneity between this trial and those including participants with type 2 diabetes (pheterogeneity {$>$}0{$\cdot$}05). There was no difference in the risk of serious adverse events, including acute pancreatitis and severe hypoglycaemia, between the GLP-1 receptor agonist and placebo groups (risk ratio [RR] 0{$\cdot$}95, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}90-1{$\cdot$}01; I2 =88{$\cdot$}5\%). However, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred more frequently in the GLP-1 receptor agonist groups (RR 1{$\cdot$}51, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}18-1{$\cdot$}94; I2 =96{$\cdot$}3\%). INTERPRETATION: We found evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists significantly reduce clinically important kidney events, kidney failure, and cardiovascular events. FUNDING: None.},

Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), defined as~impaired coronary flow reserve (CFR) in the absence of flow-limiting coronary artery disease, identifies patients at risk for adverse events independently of traditional risk factors. OBJECTIVES: The study sought to investigate the relationship among obesity, CMD, and adverse outcomes. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing evaluation for coronary artery disease with cardiac stress positron emission~tomography demonstrating normal perfusion (N~=~827) were followed for median 5.6 years for events, including death and hospitalization for myocardial infarction or heart failure. RESULTS: An inverted independent J-shaped relationship was observed between BMI and CFR, such that in obese patients CFR decreased linearly with increasing BMI (adjusted p~{$<$} 0.0001). In adjusted analyses, CFR but not BMI remained independently associated with events (for a 1-U decrease in CFR, adjusted hazard ratio: 1.95; 95\% confidence interval: 1.41 to 2.69; p~{$<$} 0.001; for a 10-U increase in BMI, adjusted hazard ratio: 1.20; 95\% confidence interval: 0.95~to~1.50; p~=~0.125) and improved model discrimination (C-index 0.71 to 0.74). In obese patients, individuals with~impaired CFR demonstrated a higher adjusted rate of events (5.7\% vs. 2.6\%; p~=~0.002), even in those not currently meeting indications for bariatric surgery (6.4\% vs. 2.6\%; p~=~0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In patients referred for testing, CMD was independently associated with elevated BMI and adverse outcomes, and was a better discriminator of risk than BMI and traditional risk factors. CFR may facilitate management of obese patients beyond currently used markers of risk.},

This result was obtained by comparing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for obesity from a model adjusted for smoking was 1.07 (95~\% CI 1.00, 1.15) with one that did not adjust for smoking was 1.10 (95~\% CI 1.03, 1.18). However, among smokers with CVD, the obesity IRR was 0.89 (95~\% CI 0.81, 0.99), while among non-smokers with CVD the obesity IRR was 1.20 (95~\% CI 1.03, 1.41). The empirical and graphical explanations presented suggest that the magnitude of the confounding bias induced by smoking is greater in the presence of collider stratification bias.},

  abstract = {Objectives The objectives of this article are to demonstrate that the obesity paradox may be explained by collider stratification bias and to estimate the biasing effects of unmeasured common causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality on the observed obesity-mortality relationship. Methods We use directed acyclic graphs, regression modeling, and sensitivity analyses to explore whether the observed protective effect of obesity among individuals with CVD can be plausibly attributed to selection bias. Data from the third National Health and Examination Survey was used for the analyses. Results The adjusted total effect of obesity on mortality was a risk difference (RD) of 0.03 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.05). However, the controlled direct effect of obesity on mortality among individuals without CVD was RD~=~0.03 (95\% CI: 0.01, 0.05) and RD~=~-0.12 (95\% CI:~-0.20,~-0.04) among individuals with CVD. The adjusted total effect estimate demonstrates an increased number of deaths among obese individuals relative to nonobese counterparts, whereas the controlled direct effect shows a paradoxical decrease in morality among obese individuals with CVD. Conclusions Sensitivity analysis demonstrates unmeasured confounding of the mediator-outcome relationship provides a sufficient explanation for the observed protective effect of obesity on mortality among individuals with CVD.},

Method The paper is divided into three parts. First, possible explanations for the obesity paradox are reviewed. Second, a simulated example is provided to describe collider stratification bias and how it could generate the obesity paradox. Finally, an example is provided using data from 17,636 participants in the US National and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Generalized linear models were fit to assess the effect of obesity on mortality both in the general population and among individuals with diagnosed cardiovascular disease (CVD). Additionally, results from a bias analysis are presented. Results In the general population, the adjusted risk ratio relating obesity and all-cause mortality was 1.24 (95\% CI 1.11, 1.39). Adjusted risk ratios comparing obese and non-obese among individuals with and without CVD were 0.79 (95\% CI 0.68, 0.91) and 1.30 (95\% CI=1.12, 1.50), indicating that obesity has a protective association among individuals with CVD. Conclusion Results demonstrate that collider stratification bias is one plausible explanation for the obesity paradox. After conditioning on CVD status in the design or analysis, obesity can appear protective among individuals with CVD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ultrafiltration is an alternative strategy to diuretic therapy for the treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Little is known about the efficacy and safety of ultrafiltration in patients with acute decompensated heart failure complicated by persistent congestion and worsened renal function. METHODS: We randomly assigned a total of 188 patients with acute decompensated heart failure, worsened renal function, and persistent congestion to a strategy of stepped pharmacologic therapy (94 patients) or ultrafiltration (94 patients). The primary end point was the bivariate change from baseline in the serum creatinine level and body weight, as assessed 96 hours after random assignment. Patients were followed for 60 days. RESULTS: Ultrafiltration was inferior to pharmacologic therapy with respect to the bivariate end point of the change in the serum creatinine level and body weight 96 hours after enrollment (P=0.003), owing primarily to an increase in the creatinine level in the ultrafiltration group. At 96 hours, the mean change in the creatinine level was -0.04{\textpm}0.53 mg per deciliter (-3.5{\textpm}46.9 {$\mu$}mol per liter) in the pharmacologic-therapy group, as compared with +0.23{\textpm}0.70 mg per deciliter (20.3{\textpm}61.9 {$\mu$}mol per liter) in the ultrafiltration group (P=0.003). There was no significant difference in weight loss 96 hours after enrollment between patients in the pharmacologic-therapy group and those in the ultrafiltration group (a loss of 5.5{\textpm}5.1 kg [12.1{\textpm}11.3 lb] and 5.7{\textpm}3.9 kg [12.6{\textpm}8.5 lb], respectively; P=0.58). A higher percentage of patients in the ultrafiltration group than in the pharmacologic-therapy group had a serious adverse event (72\% vs. 57\%, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial involving patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure, worsened renal function, and persistent congestion, the use of a stepped pharmacologic-therapy algorithm was superior to a strategy of ultrafiltration for the preservation of renal function at 96 hours, with a similar amount of weight loss with the two approaches. Ultrafiltration was associated with a higher rate of adverse events. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00608491.).},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: The mechanisms underlying obesity-mediated cardiovascular disease are not fully understood. Aldosterone and insulin resistance both are associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to test the hypotheses that aldosterone production is elevated and associated with insulin resistance in overweight adults on a high-sodium diet. PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTIONS: Healthy normotensive adults were categorized as lean body mass index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m(2) (n = 63) or overweight BMI 25 kg/m(2) or greater (n = 57). After 7 d of a high-sodium diet, participants fasted overnight and remained supine throughout hemodynamic and laboratory assessments and angiotensin II (AngII) stimulation. RESULTS: The overweight group, compared with the lean group, had higher 24-h urinary aldosterone (9.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 6.6 +/- 0.5 microg per 24 h; P = 0.003) and higher AngII-stimulated serum aldosterone (11.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 9.0 +/- 0.6 ng/dl; P = 0.04). There were no differences in 24-h urinary cortisol or sodium or supine measurements of plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone, or serum potassium. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was predicted by urinary aldosterone excretion (r = 0.32, P = 0.03) and serum aldosterone response to AngII stimulation (r = 0.28, P = 0.02) independent of age and BMI. CONCLUSION: Urinary aldosterone excretion and AngII-stimulated aldosterone are increased in overweight, compared with lean, normotensive adults. The correlation of these measures of aldosterone production with insulin resistance suggests a potential role for aldosterone in the pathophysiology of obesity-mediated insulin resistance.},

In STEP 2 (individuals with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss was -9.6\% with semaglutide 2.4~mg versus -3.4\% with placebo from baseline to week 68. Improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, including high blood pressure, atherogenic lipids and benefits on physical function and quality of life were seen with semaglutide 2.4~mg. The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4~mg was consistent across trials, primarily gastrointestinal adverse events.

  abstract = {Background BMI is known to be strongly associated with all-cause mortality, but few studies have been large enough to reliably examine associations between BMI and a comprehensive range of cause-specific mortality outcomes. Methods In this population-based cohort study, we used UK primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to national mortality registration data and fitted adjusted Cox regression models to examine associations between BMI and all-cause mortality, and between BMI and a comprehensive range of cause-specific mortality outcomes (recorded by International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10] codes). We included all individuals with BMI data collected at age 16 years and older and with subsequent follow-up time available. Follow-up began at whichever was the latest of: start of CPRD research-standard follow up, the 5-year anniversary of the first BMI record, or on Jan 1, 1998 (start date for death registration data); follow-up ended at death or on March 8, 2016. Fully adjusted models were stratified by sex and adjusted for baseline age, smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, index of multiple deprivation, and calendar period. Models were fitted in both never-smokers only and the full study population. We also did an extensive range of sensitivity analyses. The expected age of death for men and women aged 40 years at baseline, by BMI category, was estimated from a Poisson model including BMI, age, and sex. Findings 3\hphantom{,}632\hphantom{,}674 people were included in the full study population; the following results are from the analysis of never-smokers, which comprised 1\hphantom{,}969\hphantom{,}648 people and 188\hphantom{,}057 deaths. BMI had a J-shaped association with overall mortality; the estimated hazard ratio per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was 0{$\cdot$}81 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}80--0{$\cdot$}82) below 25 kg/m2 and 1{$\cdot$}21 (1{$\cdot$}20--1{$\cdot$}22) above this point. BMI was associated with all cause of death categories except for transport-related accidents, but the shape of the association varied. Most causes, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases, had a J-shaped association with BMI, with lowest risk occurring in the range 21--25 kg/m2. For mental and behavioural, neurological, and accidental (non-transport-related) causes, BMI was inversely associated with mortality up to 24--27 kg/m2, with little association at higher BMIs; for deaths from self-harm or interpersonal violence, an inverse linear association was observed. Associations between BMI and mortality were stronger at younger ages than at older ages, and the BMI associated with lowest mortality risk was higher in older individuals than in younger individuals. Compared with individuals of healthy weight (BMI 18{$\cdot$}5--24{$\cdot$}9 kg/m2), life expectancy from age 40 years was 4{$\cdot$}2 years shorter in obese (BMI {$\geq$}30{$\cdot$}0 kg/m2) men and 3{$\cdot$}5 years shorter in obese women, and 4{$\cdot$}3 years shorter in underweight (BMI {$<$}18{$\cdot$}5 kg/m2) men and 4{$\cdot$}5 years shorter in underweight women. When smokers were included in analyses, results for most causes of death were broadly similar, although marginally stronger associations were seen among people with lower BMI, suggesting slight residual confounding by smoking. Interpretation BMI had J-shaped associations with overall mortality and most specific causes of death; for mental and behavioural, neurological, and external causes, lower BMI was associated with increased mortality risk.

  abstract = {The Native American Pima population has the highest incidence of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) of any reported population, but the pathophysiologic mechanism is unknown. Genetic studies in Pima Indians have linked acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 10 (ACAD10) gene polymorphisms, among others, to this predisposition. The gene codes for a protein with a C-terminus region that is structurally similar to members of a family of flavoenzymes-the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs)-that catalyze {$\alpha$},{$\beta$}-dehydrogenation reactions, including the first step in mitochondrial FAO (FAO), and intermediary reactions in amino acids catabolism. Dysregulation of FAO and an increase in plasma acylcarnitines are recognized as important in the pathophysiology of IR and T2DM. To investigate the deficiency of ACAD10 as a monogenic risk factor for T2DM in human, an Acad-deficient mouse was generated and characterized. The deficient mice exhibit an abnormal glucose tolerance test and elevated insulin levels. Blood acylcarnitine analysis shows an increase in long-chain species in the older mice. Nonspecific variable pattern of elevated short-terminal branch-chain acylcarnitines in a variety of tissues was also observed. Acad10 mice accumulate excess abdominal adipose tissue, develop an early inflammatory liver process, exhibit fasting rhabdomyolysis, and have abnormal skeletal muscle mitochondria. Our results identify Acad10 as a genetic determinant of T2DM in mice and provide a model to further investigate genetic determinants for insulin resistance in humans.},

  abstract = {AIM: The expression of leptin and resistin is known to be positively correlated with the incidence of chronic heart failure (CHF). Both adipokines have been implicated in immunomodulation and cardiac remodelling. Therefore, we performed for the first time a clinical study to elucidate the effects of leptin and resistin on progression of CHF in patients with non-ischaemic dilated (DCM) and inflammatory (DCMi) cardiomyopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: For the clinical study 120 patients were divided into a control (n = 16), DCM (n = 52), and DCMi (n = 52) group to determine the effect of leptin and resistin on CHF progression. Nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) activation, reactive oxygen species generation, and tumour necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression following adipokine exposition were determined in vitro in cardiomyocytes. Leptin and resistin systemic plasma levels and not cardiac expression were significantly elevated in patients with DCM (leptin, 13.12 {\textpm} 17.2 ng/mL, P {$<$} 0.05; resistin, 6.87 {\textpm} 2.25 ng/mL, P {$<$} 0.05) and DCMi (leptin, 13.63 {\textpm} 16 ng/mL, P {$<$} 0.05; resistin, 7.27 {\textpm} 2.2 ng/mL, P {$<$} 0.05) compared with the control group (leptin, 7.34 {\textpm} 5.7 ng/mL; resistin, 4.4 {\textpm} 1.18 ng/mL). A multivariate linear regression model revealed low leptin and resistin plasma levels as contributors for favourable cardiac functional parameters at 6-month follow-up independent of inflammatory conditions. Cell culture experiments in vitro showed leptin and resistin to be potent regulators of TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-6 expression in cardiomyocytes, leading to significantly increased redox stress in cardiac cells. CONCLUSIONS: High leptin and resistin expression in patients with DCM and DCMi is associated with CHF progression, i.e. severe cardiac dysfunction, independent of immune responses.},

We provide evidence for genetic correlation with phenotypes related to pain, the main disease symptom, and identify likely causal genes linked to neuronal processes.

METHODS: Relative risks (RRs) of CHD associated with moderate overweight and obesity with and without adjustment for blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations were calculated by the members of a collaboration of prospective cohort studies of healthy, mainly white persons and pooled by means of random-effects models (RRs for categories of BMI in 14 cohorts and for continuous BMI in 21 cohorts; total N = 302 296). RESULTS: A total of 18 000 CHD events occurred during follow-up. The age-, sex-, physical activity-, and smoking-adjusted RRs (95\% confidence intervals) for moderate overweight and obesity compared with normal weight were 1.32 (1.24-1.40) and 1.81 (1.56-2.10), respectively. Additional adjustment for blood pressure and cholesterol levels reduced the RR to 1.17 (1.11-1.23) for moderate overweight and to 1.49 (1.32-1.67) for obesity. The RR associated with a 5-unit BMI increment was 1.29 (1.22-1.35) before and 1.16 (1.11-1.21) after adjustment for blood pressure and cholesterol levels. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects of overweight on blood pressure and cholesterol levels could account for about 45\% of the increased risk of CHD. Even for moderate overweight, there is a significant increased risk of CHD independent of these traditional risk factors, although confounding (eg, by dietary factors) cannot be completely ruled out.},

It remains unclear whether ischemic risk and the benefits of prolonged P2Y12 inhibition in this population remain consistent over time. Objectives The study sought to investigate the pattern of ischemic risk over time and whether the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor were similar early and late after randomization. Methods The PEGASUS-TIMI (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin--Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) 54 trial randomized patients with prior MI (median 1.7 years prior) to ticagrelor 90 mg, ticagrelor 60 mg, or placebo on a background of aspirin. The rates of cardiovascular (CV) death, MI, and stroke as well as TIMI major bleeding were analyzed at yearly landmarks (years 1, 2, and 3). Results A total of 21,162 patients were randomized and followed for 33 months (median), with 28\% of patients {$\geq$}5 years from MI at trial conclusion. The risk of CV death, MI, or stroke in the placebo arm remained roughly constant over the trial at an {$\sim$}3\% annualized rate. The benefit of ticagrelor 60 mg was consistent at each subsequent landmark (year 1 hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.99; year 2 HR: 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.74 to 1.11; and year 3 HR: 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.62 to 1.00). TIMI major bleeding was increased with ticagrelor 60 mg at each landmark, but with the greatest hazard in the first year (year 1 HR: 3.22; year 2 HR: 2.07; year 3 HR: 1.65). Conclusions Patients with a history of MI remain at persistent high risk for CVD, MI, and stroke as late as 5 years after MI. The efficacy of low-dose ticagrelor is consistent over time with a trend toward less excess bleeding.

Short-term administration of inorganic nitrite or nitrate preparations has been shown to enhance nitric oxide signaling, which may improve aerobic capacity in HFpEF. Objective: To determine the effect of 4 weeks' administration of inhaled, nebulized inorganic nitrite on exercise capacity in HFpEF. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment, crossover trial of 105 patients with HFpEF. Participants were enrolled from July 22, 2016, to September 12, 2017, at 17 US sites, with final date of follow-up of January 2, 2018. Interventions: Inorganic nitrite or placebo administered via micronebulizer device. During each 6-week phase of the crossover study, participants received no study drug for 2 weeks (baseline/washout) followed by study drug (nitrite or placebo) at 46 mg 3 times a day for 1 week followed by 80 mg 3 times a day for 3 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min). Secondary end points included daily activity levels assessed by accelerometry, health status as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (score range, 0-100, with higher scores reflecting better quality of life), functional class, cardiac filling pressures assessed by echocardiography, N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels, other exercise indices, adverse events, and tolerability. Outcomes were assessed after treatment for 4 weeks. Results: Among 105 patients who were randomized (median age, 68 years; 56\% women), 98 (93\%) completed the trial. During the nitrite phase, there was no significant difference in mean peak oxygen consumption as compared with the placebo phase (13.5 vs 13.7 mL/kg/min; difference, -0.20 [95\% CI, -0.56 to 0.16]; P =.27). There were no significant between-treatment phase differences in daily activity levels (5497 vs 5503 accelerometry units; difference, -15 [95\% CI, -264 to 234]; P =.91), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (62.6 vs 61.9; difference, 1.1 [95\% CI, -1.4 to 3.5]; P =.39), functional class (2.5 vs 2.5; difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -0.1 to 0.2]; P =.43), echocardiographic E/e{$\prime$} ratio (16.4 vs 16.6; difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -1.2 to 1.3]; P =.93), or N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels (520 vs 533 pg/mL; difference, 11 [95\% CI, -53 to 75]; P =.74). Worsening heart failure occurred in 3 participants (2.9\%) during the nitrite phase and 8 (7.6\%) during the placebo phase. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with HFpEF, administration of inhaled inorganic nitrite for 4 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity.

Secondary end points included daily activity levels assessed by accelerometry, health status as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (score range, 0-100, with higher scores reflecting better quality of life), functional class, cardiac filling pressures assessed by echocardiography, N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels, other exercise indices, adverse events, and tolerability. Outcomes were assessed after treatment for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Among 105 patients who were randomized (median age, 68 years; 56\% women), 98 (93\%) completed the trial. During the nitrite phase, there was no significant difference in mean peak oxygen consumption as compared with the placebo phase (13.5 vs 13.7 mL/kg/min; difference, -0.20 [95\% CI, -0.56 to 0.16]; P\,=\,.27). There were no significant between-treatment phase differences in daily activity levels (5497 vs 5503 accelerometry units; difference, -15 [95\% CI, -264 to 234]; P\,=\,.91), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (62.6 vs 61.9; difference, 1.1 [95\% CI, -1.4 to 3.5]; P\,=\,.39), functional class (2.5 vs 2.5; difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -0.1 to 0.2]; P\,=\,.43), echocardiographic E/e' ratio (16.4 vs 16.6; difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -1.2 to 1.3]; P\,=\,.93), or N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels (520 vs 533 pg/mL; difference, 11 [95\% CI, -53 to 75]; P\,=\,.74). Worsening heart failure occurred in 3 participants (2.9\%) during the nitrite phase and 8 (7.6\%) during the placebo phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with HFpEF, administration of inhaled inorganic nitrite for 4 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity.

This prespecified analysis examined the effects of semaglutide on dual primary endpoints (change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) and body weight) and confirmatory secondary endpoints (change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), hierarchical composite (death, HF events, change in KCCQ-CSS and 6MWD) and change in C-reactive protein (CRP)) across obesity classes I--III (body mass index (BMI) 30.0--34.9\,kg\,m-2, 35.0--39.9\,kg\,m-2 and {$\geq$}40\,kg\,m-2) and according to body weight reduction with semaglutide after 52\,weeks. Semaglutide consistently improved all outcomes across obesity categories (P value for treatment effects\,{\texttimes}\,BMI interactions\,=\,not significant for all). In semaglutide-treated patients, improvements in KCCQ-CSS, 6MWD and CRP were greater with larger body weight reduction (for example, 6.4-point (95\% confidence interval (CI): 4.1, 8.8) and 14.4-m (95\% CI: 5.5, 23.3) improvements in KCCQ-CSS and 6MWD for each 10\% body weight reduction). In participants with obesity phenotype of HFpEF, semaglutide improved symptoms, physical limitations and exercise function and reduced inflammation and body weight across obesity categories. In semaglutide-treated patients, the magnitude of benefit was directly related to the extent of weight loss. Collectively, these data support semaglutide-mediated weight loss as a key treatment strategy in patients with obesity phenotype of HFpEF. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04788511.},

  abstract = {Background: It is unclear which anthropometric measure is most useful for assessment of the cardiovascular risk. We investigated the association between different anthropometric measures and risk of heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Methods: BMI, waist--hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference (WC), body fat percentage (BF\%), weight and height were measured among 26\,653 subjects (aged 45--73 years) without history of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or HF from the Malm{\"o} Diet and Cancer cohort at baseline in 1991--96. Incidence of HF hospitalizations was monitored during a mean follow-up of 15 years. Results: Seven hundred and twenty-seven subjects were hospitalized with HF as primary diagnosis, of whom 157 had an MI before or concurrent with the HF. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the hazard ratios of HF hospitalization (fourth vs. first sex-specific quartile) were 1.80 (95\% CI: 1.45--2.24) for BMI, 1.87 (1.50--2.34) for WC, 1.77 (1.43--2.19) for WHR, 1.35 (1.09--1.68) for BF\%, 1.93 (1.57--2.39) for weight and 1.18 (0.96--1.44) for height. Significant interactions between BMI and WC and WHR, respectively, were observed, and the joint exposure of high BMI and high WC or high WHR further increased the risk. The results were similar in secondary analyses, i.e. excluding incident HF with previous MI during the follow-up. Conclusion: Our results support the view that raised BMI, WC, WHR or BF\% increases the risk of HF hospitalization. The joint exposure of high BMI and high WHR or high WC further increased the risk in an additive way.},

We propose revised stages of HF as follows. At-risk for HF (Stage A), for patients at risk for HF but without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF and without structural or biomarkers evidence of heart disease. Pre-HF (stage B), for patients without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF, but evidence of structural heart disease or abnormal cardiac function, or elevated natriuretic peptide levels. HF (Stage C), for patients with current or prior symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality. Advanced HF (Stage D), for patients with severe symptoms and/or signs of HF at rest, recurrent hospitalizations despite guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT), refractory or intolerant to GDMT, requiring advanced therapies such as consideration for transplant, mechanical circulatory support, or palliative care. Finally, we propose a new and revised classification of HF according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The classification includes HF with reduced EF (HFrEF): HF with an LVEF of {$\leq$}40\%; HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF): HF with an LVEF of 41\% to 49\%; HF with preserved EF (HFpEF): HF with an LVEF of {$\geq$}50\%; and HF with improved EF (HFimpEF): HF with a baseline LVEF of {$\leq$}40\%, a {$\geq$}10-point increase from baseline LVEF, and a second measurement of LVEF of {$>$}40\%.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To provide the first systematic analysis of the burden and underlying causes of heart failure (HF) in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected detailed information on prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), and underlying causes of HF from the Global Burden of Disease study 2017. Numbers and age-standardized rates of HF prevalence and YLDs were compared by age, sex, socio-demographic index (SDI), and location. The proportions of HF age-standardized prevalence rates due to 23 underlying causes were also presented. Globally, the age-standardized prevalence and YLD rates of HF in 2017 were 831.0 and 128.2 per 100~000 people, a decrease of -7.2\% and -0.9\% from 1990, respectively. Nevertheless, the absolute numbers of HF prevalent cases and YLDs have increased by 91.9\% and 106.0\% from 1990, respectively. There is significant geographic and socio-demographic variation in the levels and trends of HF burden from 1990 to 2017. Among all causes of HF, ischaemic heart disease accounted for the highest proportion (26.5\%) of age-standardized prevalence rate of HF in 2017, followed by hypertensive heart disease (26.2\%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (23.4\%). CONCLUSION: HF remains a serious public health problem worldwide, with increasing age-standardized prevalence and YLD rates in countries with relatively low SDI. More geo-specific strategies aimed at preventing underlying causes and improving medical care for HF are warranted to reduce the future burden of this condition.},

We aimed to investigate molecular mechanisms, signaling pathways, and functional significance of adipocyte-derived aldosterone and to test whether adipocyte-derived aldosterone is increased in diabetes mellitus-associated obesity, which contributes to vascular dysfunction. Studies were performed in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line and mature adipocytes isolated from human and mouse (C57BL/6J) adipose tissue. Mesenteric arteries with and without perivascular fat and mature adipocytes were obtained from obese diabetic db/db and control db/+ mice. Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2; mRNA and protein) was detected in 3T3-L1 and mature adipocytes, which secrete aldosterone basally and in response to angiotensin II (Ang II). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Ang II stimulation increased aldosterone secretion and CYP11B2 expression. Ang II effects were blunted by an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist (candesartan) and inhibitors of calcineurin (cyclosporine A and FK506) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (VIVIT). FAD286 (aldosterone synthase inhibitor) blunted adipocyte differentiation. In candesartan-treated db/db mice (1 mg/kg per day, 4 weeks) increased plasma aldosterone, CYP11B2 expression, and aldosterone secretion were reduced. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation in db/db mesenteric arteries containing perivascular fat was improved by eplerenone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) without effect in db/+ mice. Adipocytes possess aldosterone synthase and produce aldosterone in an Ang II/Ang II type 1 receptor/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells-dependent manner. Functionally adipocyte-derived aldosterone regulates adipocyte differentiation and vascular function in an autocrine and paracrine manner, respectively. These novel findings identify adipocytes as a putative link between aldosterone and vascular dysfunction in diabetes mellitus-associated obesity.},

  abstract = {The steroid hormone aldosterone regulates sodium and potassium homeostasis. Aldosterone and activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor also causes inflammation and fibrosis of the heart, fibrosis and remodelling of blood vessels and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and glomerular injury in the kidney. Aldosterone and mineralocorticoid-receptor activation initiate an inflammatory response by increasing the generation of reactive oxygen species by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and mitochondria. High salt intake potentiates these effects, in part by activating the Rho family member Rac1, a regulatory subunit of reduced NADPH oxidase that activates the mineralocorticoid receptor. Studies in mice in which the mineralocorticoid receptor has been deleted from specific cell types suggest a key role for macrophages in promoting inflammation and fibrosis. Aldosterone can exert mineralocorticoid-receptor-independent effects via the angiotensin II receptor and via G-protein-coupled receptor 30. Mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists are associated with decreased mortality in patients with heart disease and show promise in patients with kidney injury, but can elevate serum potassium concentration. Studies in rodents genetically deficient in aldosterone synthase or treated with a pharmacological aldosterone-synthase inhibitor are providing insight into the relative contribution of aldosterone compared with the contribution of mineralocorticoid-receptor activation in inflammation, fibrosis, and injury. Aldosterone-synthase inhibitors are under development in humans.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization analyses are often performed using summarized data. The causal estimate from a one-sample analysis (in which data are taken from a single data source) with weak instrumental variables is biased in the direction of the observational association between the risk factor and outcome, whereas the estimate from a two-sample analysis (in which data on the risk factor and outcome are taken from non-overlapping datasets) is less biased and any bias is in the direction of the null. When using genetic consortia that have partially overlapping sets of participants, the direction and extent of bias are uncertain. In this paper, we perform simulation studies to investigate the magnitude of bias and Type 1 error rate inflation arising from sample overlap. We consider both a continuous outcome and a case-control setting with a binary outcome. For a continuous outcome, bias due to sample overlap is a linear function of the proportion of overlap between the samples. So, in the case of a null causal effect, if the relative bias of the one-sample instrumental variable estimate is 10\% (corresponding to an F parameter of 10), then the relative bias with 50\% sample overlap is 5\%, and with 30\% sample overlap is 3\%. In a case-control setting, if risk factor measurements are only included for the control participants, unbiased estimates are obtained even in a one-sample setting. However, if risk factor data on both control and case participants are used, then bias is similar with a binary outcome as with a continuous outcome. Consortia releasing publicly available data on the associations of genetic variants with continuous risk factors should provide estimates that exclude case participants from case-control samples.},

Lv et al., https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae206.In their study, published in this issue of the European Heart Journal, Lv et al. examine the relationships of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference with mortality outcomes in a dataset of elderly Chinese individuals using conventional and genetic epidemiological approaches.1 They show that higher BMI and higher waist circumference are associated with lower risk of mortality in observational analyses. In genetic analyses, higher genetically predicted BMI was associated with a lower risk of mortality, but higher genetically predicted waist circumference was associated with a higher risk of mortality. These results differ from most previous investigations into the relationship between body size and mortality.2 However, on closer inspection, there are clear reasons that lead to these discrepancies. First, the population in this study is elderly, with all participants being over 80 years old, with the mean participant age at 90.6 years. Second, the distribution of BMI is low, with \&gt;40\% of participants having a BMI \&lt;18.5\>kg/m2. While obesity is generally associated with higher mortality risk, several observational analyses have reported the lowest level of disease risk at {$\sim$}25\>kg/m2,3 which is towards the top end of the BMI distribution in the Chinese dataset. Hence, while this analysis indicates that high BMI is good and other analyses have indicated that high BMI is bad, the findings presented here do not contradict the overall observational picture for middle-aged healthy populations, which is a U-shaped relationship. This analysis provides important information to aid prediction of mortality in underweight elderly individuals, who will differ from middle-aged populations not only in the population distribution of BMI, but also in the ratios of lean mass and muscle mass to fat mass.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization investigations are becoming more powerful and simpler to perform, due to the increasing size and coverage of genome-wide association studies and the increasing availability of summarized data on genetic associations with risk factors and disease outcomes. However, when using multiple genetic variants from different gene regions in a Mendelian randomization analysis, it is highly implausible that all the genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable assumptions. This means that a simple instrumental variable analysis alone should not be relied on to give a causal conclusion. In this article, we discuss a range of sensitivity analyses that will either support or question the validity of causal inference from a Mendelian randomization analysis with multiple genetic variants. We focus on sensitivity analyses of greatest practical relevance for ensuring robust causal inferences, and those that can be undertaken using summarized data. Aside from cases in which the justification of the instrumental variable assumptions is supported by strong biological understanding, a Mendelian randomization analysis in which no assessment of the robustness of the findings to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions has been made should be viewed as speculative and incomplete. In particular, Mendelian randomization investigations with large numbers of genetic variants without such sensitivity analyses should be treated with skepticism.},

This demonstrates that the hypothalamic GLP-1R is sufficient but does not show whether it is necessary for the effects of exogenous GLP-1R agonists (GLP-1RA) or endogenous GLP-1 on these parameters. To address this, we crossed mice harboring floxed Glp1r alleles to mice expressing Nkx2.1-Cre to knock down Glp1r expression throughout the hypothalamus (GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Nkx2.1cre). We also generated mice lacking Glp1r expression specifically in two GLP-1RA--responsive hypothalamic feeding nuclei/cell types, the paraventricular nucleus (GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Sim1cre) and proopiomelanocortin neurons (GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}POMCcre). Chow-fed GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Nkx2.1cre mice exhibited increased food intake and energy expenditure with no net effect on body weight. When fed a high-fat diet, these mice exhibited normal food intake but elevated energy expenditure, yielding reduced weight gain. None of these phenotypes were observed in GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Sim1cre and GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}POMCcre mice. The acute anorectic and glucose tolerance effects of peripherally dosed GLP-1RA exendin-4 and liraglutide were preserved in all mouse lines. Chronic liraglutide treatment reduced body weight in chow-fed GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Nkx2.1cre mice, but this effect was attenuated with high-fat diet feeding. In sum, classic homeostatic control regions are sufficient but not individually necessary for the effects of GLP-1RA on nutrient homeostasis.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Persistent congestion is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (AHF). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists administered at high doses may relieve congestion, overcome diuretic resistance, and mitigate the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation in AHF. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of high-dose spironolactone and usual care on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels compared with usual care alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind and placebo (or low-dose)-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 22 US acute care hospitals among patients with AHF who were previously receiving no or low-dose (12.5 mg or 25 mg daily) spironolactone and had NT-proBNP levels of 1000 pg/mL or more or B-type natriuretic peptide levels of 250 pg/mL or more, regardless of ejection fraction. INTERVENTIONS: High-dose spironolactone (100 mg) vs placebo or 25 mg spironolactone (usual care) daily for 96 hours MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the change in NT-proBNP levels from baseline to 96 hours. Secondary end points included the clinical congestion score, dyspnea assessment, net urine output, and net weight change. Safety end points included hyperkalemia and changes in renal function. RESULTS: A total of 360 patients were randomized, of whom the median age was 65 years, 129 (36\%) were women, 200 (55.5\%) were white, 151 (42\%) were black, 8 (2\%) were Hispanic or Latino, 9 (2.5\%) were of other race/ethnicity, and the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 34\%. Baseline median (interquartile range) NT-proBNP levels were 4601 (2697-9596) pg/mL among the group treated with high-dose spironolactone and 3753 (1968-7633) pg/mL among the group who received usual care. There was no significant difference in the log NT-proBNP reduction between the 2 groups (-0.55 [95\% CI, -0.92 to -0.18] with high-dose spironolactone and -0.49 [95\% CI, -0.98 to -0.14] with usual care, P = .57). None of the secondary end point or day-30 all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization rate differed between the 2 groups. The changes in serum potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adding treatment with high-dose spironolactone to usual care for patients with AHF for 96 hours was well tolerated but did not improve the primary or secondary efficacy end points.

METHODS: A pragmatic open adaptive noninferiority trial with 3-year follow-up was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to bypass or band initially and to sleeve after the adaptation. Co-primary end points are weight loss and health-related quality of life assessed using the EQ-5D utility index. RESULTS: Between December 2012 and August 2015, the study recruited into two groups and, after the adaptation, into three groups until September 2019. The study screened 6960 patients; 4732 (68\%) were eligible and 1351 (29\%) were randomized; 5 subsequently withdrew consent to use data, leaving 462, 464, and 420 assigned to bypass, band, and sleeve, respectively. Baseline data showed high levels of obesity (mean BMI~=~46.4~kg/m2; SD: 6.9) and comorbidities (e.g., 31\% diabetes), low scores for health-related quality of life, and high levels of anxiety and depression (e.g., 25\% abnormal scores). Nutritional parameters were poor, and the average equivalized household income was low ({\pounds}16,667). CONCLUSIONS: By-Band-Sleeve fully recruited. Participant characteristics are consistent with contemporary patients having bariatric surgery, and therefore the results will be generalizable.},

Recently, the principle has been applied to other forms of bias in observational studies, especially collider bias that arises when conditioning or stratifying on a variable that is associated with the outcome of interest. An important case is in studies of disease progression and survival. Here, we clarify the links between the genetic instrumental variable methods proposed for this problem and the established methods of Mendelian randomisation developed to account for confounding. We highlight the critical importance of weak instrument bias in this context and describe a corrected weighted least-squares procedure as a simple approach to reduce this bias. We illustrate the range of available methods on two data examples. The first, waist-hip ratio adjusted for body-mass index, entails statistical adjustment for a quantitative trait. The second, smoking cessation, is a stratified analysis conditional on having initiated smoking. In both cases, we find little effect of collider bias on the primary association results, but this may propagate into more substantial effects on further analyses such as polygenic risk scoring and Mendelian randomisation.},

  abstract = {Common heart failure has a strong undefined heritable component. Two recent independent cardiovascular SNP array studies identified a common SNP at 1p36 in intron 2 of the HSPB7 gene as being associated with heart failure. HSPB7 resequencing identified other risk alleles but no functional gene variants. Here, we further show no effect of the HSPB7 SNP on cardiac HSPB7 mRNA levels or splicing, suggesting that the SNP marks the position of a functional variant in another gene. Accordingly, we used massively parallel platforms to resequence all coding exons of the adjacent CLCNKA gene, which encodes the K(a) renal chloride channel (ClC-K(a)). Of 51 exonic CLCNKA variants identified, one SNP (rs10927887, encoding Arg83Gly) was common, in linkage disequilibrium with the heart failure risk SNP in HSPB7, and associated with heart failure in two independent Caucasian referral populations (n = 2,606 and 1,168; combined P = 2.25 {\texttimes} 10(-6)). Individual genotyping of rs10927887 in the two study populations and a third independent heart failure cohort (combined n = 5,489) revealed an additive allele effect on heart failure risk that is independent of age, sex, and prior hypertension (odds ratio = 1.27 per allele copy; P = 8.3 {\texttimes} 10(-7)). Functional characterization of recombinant wild-type Arg83 and variant Gly83 ClC-K(a) chloride channel currents revealed {$\approx$} 50\% loss-of-function of the variant channel. These findings identify a common, functionally significant genetic risk factor for Caucasian heart failure. The variant CLCNKA risk allele, telegraphed by linked variants in the adjacent HSPB7 gene, uncovers a previously overlooked genetic mechanism affecting the cardio-renal axis.},

  abstract = {Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the commonest cause of death. Here, we report an association analysis in 63,746 CAD cases and 130,681 controls identifying 15 loci reaching genome-wide significance, taking the number of susceptibility loci for CAD to 46, and a further 104 independent variants (r(2) {$<$} 0.2) strongly associated with CAD at a 5\% false discovery rate (FDR). Together, these variants explain approximately 10.6\% of CAD heritability. Of the 46 genome-wide significant lead SNPs, 12 show a significant association with a lipid trait, and 5 show a significant association with blood pressure, but none is significantly associated with diabetes. Network analysis with 233 candidate genes (loci at 10\% FDR) generated 5 interaction networks comprising 85\% of these putative genes involved in CAD. The four most significant pathways mapping to these networks are linked to lipid metabolism and inflammation, underscoring the causal role of these activities in the genetic etiology of CAD. Our study provides insights into the genetic basis of CAD and identifies key biological pathways.},

  abstract = {PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format.To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, (n)-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0).The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Weight loss in response to the long-acting GLP-1 receptor (GLP1R) analog, liraglutide, is correlated with delay in gastric-emptying (GE). The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether specific genetic variants in GLP1R or TCF7L2 are associated with delayed GE and weight loss in obese patients treated with liraglutide or the short-acting GLP-1 agonist, exenatide. METHODS: We evaluated in obese individuals the associations of genetic variations of GLP1R (rs6923761) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146) on GE T1/2 and weight from two trials that evaluated separately exenatide, 5~{$\mu$}g BID for 30~days, or liraglutide, 3~mg daily for 5~weeks. Data were analyzed using the dominant genetic model and intention-to-treat analysis. KEY RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between changes in weight and GE T1/2 (rs ~=~-.382, P~=~.004). GLP1R rs6923761 minor allele A (AA\_AG) carriers who received either exenatide or liraglutide had greater delay in GE T1/2 relative to baseline (117.9~{\textpm}~27.5 [SEM] minutes and 128.9~{\textpm}~38.32~minutes) compared to GG genotype (95.8~{\textpm}~30.4~minutes and 61.4~{\textpm}~21.4~minutes, respectively; P~=~.11). There was a non-significant difference in weight loss based on GLP1R rs6923761 genotype after 5~weeks of treatment. There were no significant correlations with TCF7L2 (rs7903146) genotype. CONCLUSIONS \& INFERENCES: The minor A allele of GLP1R (rs6923761) is associated with greater delay in GE T1/2 in response to liraglutide and exenatide. These studies provide data to plan pharmacogenetics testing of the hypothesis that GLP1R (rs6923761) influences weight loss in response to GLP1R agonists.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Small studies suggest that low-dose dopamine or low-dose nesiritide may enhance decongestion and preserve renal function in patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction; however, neither strategy has been rigorously tested. OBJECTIVE: To test the 2 independent hypotheses that, compared with placebo, addition of low-dose dopamine (2 {$\mu$}g/kg/min) or low-dose nesiritide (0.005 {$\mu$}g/kg/min without bolus) to diuretic therapy will enhance decongestion and preserve renal function in patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation [ROSE]) of 360 hospitalized patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15-60 mL/min/1.73m2), randomized within 24 hours of admission. Enrollment occurred from September 2010 to March 2013 across 26 sites in North America. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized in an open, 1:1 allocation ratio to the dopamine or nesiritide strategy. Within each strategy, participants were randomized in a double-blind, 2:1 ratio to active treatment or placebo. The dopamine (n = 122) and nesiritide (n = 119) groups were independently compared with the pooled placebo group (n = 119). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary end points included 72-hour cumulative urine volume (decongestion end point) and the change in serum cystatin C from enrollment to 72 hours (renal function end point). RESULTS: Compared with placebo, low-dose dopamine had no significant effect on 72-hour cumulative urine volume (dopamine, 8524 mL; 95\%CI, 7917-9131 vs placebo, 8296 mL; 95\% CI, 7762-8830 ; difference, 229 mL; 95\%CI, -714 to 1171 mL; P = .59) or on the change in cystatin C level (dopamine, 0.12mg/L; 95\%CI, 0.06-0.18 vs placebo, 0.11mg/L; 95\%CI, 0.06-0.16; difference, 0.01; 95\%CI, -0.08 to 0.10; P = .72). Similarly, low-dose nesiritide had no significant effect on 72-hour cumulative urine volume (nesiritide, 8574 mL; 95\%CI, 8014-9134 vs placebo, 8296 mL; 95\%CI, 7762-8830; difference, 279 mL; 95\%CI, -618 to 1176 mL; P = .49) or on the change in cystatin C level (nesiritide, 0.07mg/L; 95\%CI, 0.01-0.13 vs placebo, 0.11mg/L; 95\%CI, 0.06-0.16; difference, -0.04; 95\%CI, -0.13 to 0.05; P = .36). Compared with placebo, there was no effect of low-dose dopamine or nesiritide on secondary end points reflective of decongestion, renal function, or clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In participants with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction, neither low-dose dopamine nor low-dose nesiritide enhanced decongestion or improved renal function when added to diuretic therapy.

  abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) maintenance is crucial to the structural integrity of adipocytes and whole adipose tissue formation. However, the potential impact of the ECM on adipocyte lineage commitment is unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that forced expression of matrix-associated metalloproteinase Adamts1 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1), which we show is targeted by microRNA-181d (miR-181d) during BMP4-induced adipocytic lineage commitment, markedly impairs adipocyte commitment. Conversely, siRNA-induced inhibition of Adamts1 promotes adipocyte commitment. Adamst1 metalloprotease activity is required for this inhibition and is determined to function via remodeling ECM components followed by activating FAK--ERK signaling pathway during the commitment process. Furthermore, ablation of Adamts1 in adipose tissue increases adipose tissue mass, reduces insulin sensitivity, and disrupts lipid homeostasis. This finding is consistent with Adamts1 decreased expression in the adipose tissue of obese mice and an inverse correlation of Adamts1 expression with body mass index in humans. Collectively, our results indicate that Adamts1 acts as an ECM `modifier', with miR-181d-induced downregulation, that regulates adipocyte lineage commitment and obesity.},

  abstract = {Background Low-grade inflammation in the young may contribute to the early development of cardiovascular disease. We assessed whether circulating levels of glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) were better able to predict the development of adverse cardiovascular disease risk profiles compared with the more commonly used biomarker high-sensitivity CRP (C-reactive protein). Methods and Results A total of 3306 adolescents and young adults from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (mean age, 15.4{\textpm}0.3; n=1750) and Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study (mean age, 32.1{\textpm}5.0; n=1556) were included. Baseline associations between inflammatory biomarkers, body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, and subclinical measures of vascular dysfunction were assessed cross-sectionally in both cohorts. Prospective risk of developing hypertension and metabolic syndrome during 9-to-10-year follow-up were also assessed as surrogate markers for future cardiovascular risk. GlycA showed greater within-subject correlation over 9-to-10-year follow-up in both cohorts compared with CRP, particularly in the younger adolescent group (r=0.36 versus 0.07). In multivariable analyses, GlycA was found to associate with multiple lifestyle-related cardiovascular disease risk factors, cardiometabolic risk factor burden, and vascular dysfunction (eg, mean difference in flow-mediated dilation=-1.2 [-1.8, -0.7]\% per z-score increase). In contrast, CRP levels appeared predominantly driven by body mass index and showed little relationship to any measured cardiovascular risk factors or phenotypes. In both cohorts, only GlycA predicted future risk of both hypertension (risk ratio [RR], {$\approx$}1.1 per z-score increase for both cohorts) and metabolic syndrome (RR, {$\approx$}1.2--1.3 per z-score increase for both cohorts) in 9-to-10-year follow-up. Conclusions Low-grade inflammation captured by the novel biomarker GlycA is associated with adverse cardiovascular risk profiles from as early as adolescence and predicts future risk of hypertension and metabolic syndrome in up to 10-year follow-up. GlycA is a stable inflammatory biomarker which may capture distinct sources of inflammation in the young and may provide a more sensitive measure than CRP for detecting early cardiovascular risk.},

  abstract = {, Over the last decade, great progress has been made in defining the genetic basis of AF. Common variants have been identified at more than 100 genetic loci, and rare mutations have implicated many genes in AF. However, the relative contribution of rare and common genetic variants to AF risk remains unclear. The population-based UK Biobank provides a unique opportunity to assess the genetic contributions to AF risk. In an exome wide analysis, we found that LOF mutations in TTN were strongly associated with AF risk and were highly penetrant. A polygenic risk score of common variants explains a great proportion of AF risk than mutations in TTN. Among TTN mutation carriers, it would be interesting in future work to determine if a subtle cardiomyopathy is present by cardiac imaging or to examine the progression to heart failure or other AF co-morbidities.},

  abstract = {A polygenic score (PGS) or polygenic risk score (PRS) is an estimate of an individual's genetic liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation---genetic liability---has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges.},

  abstract = {Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease. The worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity has doubled since 1980 to an extent that nearly a third of the world's population is now classified as overweight or obese. Obesity rates have increased in all ages and both sexes irrespective of geographical locality, ethnicity or socioeconomic status, although the prevalence of obesity is generally greater in older persons and women. This trend was similar across regions and countries, although absolute prevalence rates of overweight and obesity varied widely. For some developed countries, the prevalence rates of obesity seem to have levelled off during the past few years. Body mass index (BMI) is typically used to define overweight and obesity in epidemiological studies. However, BMI has low sensitivity and there is a large inter-individual variability in the percent body fat for any given BMI value, partly attributed to age, sex, and ethnicity. For instance, Asians have greater percent body fat than Caucasians for the same BMI. Greater cardiometabolic risk has also been associated with the localization of excess fat in the visceral adipose tissue and ectopic depots (such as muscle and liver), as well as in cases of increased fat to lean mass ratio (e.g. metabolically-obese normal-weight). These data suggest that obesity may be far more common and requires more urgent attention than what large epidemiological studies suggest. Simply relying on BMI to assess its prevalence could hinder future interventions aimed at obesity prevention and control.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To assess the relationship between body mass index (BMI), mortality and mode of death in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients; to define the shape of the relationship between BMI and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of 5010 patients from the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial. The end-points of the study were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Mortality rate was 27.2\% in underweight patients (BMI{$<$}22 kg/m2), 21.7\% in normal weight patients (BMI 22-24.9 kg/m2), 17.9\% in overweight patients (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2) and 16.5\% in obese patients (BMI{$>$}30 kg/m2) (p{$<$}0.0001). The rates of non-cardiovascular death did not differ among groups. The risk of death due to progressive heart failure was 3.4-fold higher in the underweight than in the obese patients (p{$<$}0.0001). Normal weight, overweight and obese patients had lower risk of death as compared with underweight patients (p=0.019, HR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.61-0.96; p=0.0005, HR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.55-0.84; p=0.003, HR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.52-0.88, respectively) independently of symptoms, ventricular function, beta-blocker use, C-reactive protein and brain natriuretic peptide levels. CONCLUSIONS: In CHF patients a higher BMI is associated with a better prognosis independently of other clinical variables. The relationship between mortality and BMI is monotonically decreasing.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 344 patients with advanced systolic HF had WC and BMI measured at presentation. High WC was defined as {$\geq$}88 cm in women and {$\geq$}102 cm in men, and high BMI as {$\geq$}25 kg/m(2). Two-year urgent heart transplant (UT)-free survival in high vs normal WC groups was 77.9\% vs 64.3\% (P = .025) and in high vs normal BMI was 89.8\% vs 58.2\% (P {$<$} .001). After multivariable adjustment, normal WC compared with high WC was associated with higher all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 2.76, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-5.71) and higher risk of death/UT (RR 2.14, 95\% CI 1.25-3.68). The best outcomes were seen in those with both high WC and high BMI. CONCLUSIONS: High WC, an alternative anthropometric index of obesity more specific to abdominal adiposity, high BMI, and the combination of high WC/high BMI were each associated with improved outcomes in this advanced HF cohort, lending further support for an obesity paradox in HF. The role of body composition in HF survival should be a focus of future investigation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Independent associations between cardiovascular risk factor exposures during midlife and later life development of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) versus reduced EF (HFrEF) have not been previously studied. METHODS: We pooled data from 4 US cohort studies (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, Cardiovascular Health, Health , Aging and Body Composition, and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) and imputed annual risk factor trajectories for body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose starting from age 40 years. Time-weighted average exposures to each risk factor during midlife and later life were calculated and analyzed for associations with the development of HFpEF or HFrEF. RESULTS: A total of 23,861 participants were included (mean age at first in-person visit, 61.8 {\textpm}1 0.2 years; 56.6\% female). During a median follow-up of 12 years, there were 3666 incident HF events, of which 51\% had EF measured, including 934 with HFpEF and 739 with HFrEF. A high midlife systolic blood pressure and low midlife high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with HFrEF, and a high midlife body mass index, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and glucose were associated with HFpEF. After adjusting for later life exposures, only midlife pulse pressure remained independently associated with HFpEF. CONCLUSIONS: Midlife exposure to cardiovascular risk factors are differentially associated with HFrEF and HFpEF later in life. Having a higher pulse pressure during midlife is associated with a greater risk for HFpEF but not HFrEF, independent of later life exposures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. We therefore evaluated the long-term effects of the addition of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure. METHODS: A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours. RESULTS: Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure; 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P{$<$}0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life as compared with placebo (P{$<$}0.01). In a post hoc analysis of the combined end point and mortality in subgroups defined according to base-line treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients receiving neither or one of these types of drugs but an adverse effect in patients receiving both types of drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Valsartan significantly reduces the combined end point of mortality and morbidity and improves clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, when added to prescribed therapy. However, the post hoc observation of an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta-blocker raises concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Doppler and 2D echocardiography and bioelectric impedance in 2744 Strong Heart Study participants were used to calculate SV and CO and to relate them to fat-free body mass (FFM), adipose mass, and demographic variables. Both SV and CO were higher in men than women and in overweight than normal-weight individuals, but these differences were diminished or even reversed by normalization for FFM or body surface area. In both sexes, SV and CO were more strongly related to FFM than adipose mass, other body habitus measures, arterial pressure, diabetes, or age. In multivariate analyses using the average of Doppler and left ventricular SV to minimize measurement variability, FFM was the strongest correlate of SV and CO; other independent correlates were adipose mass, systolic pressure, diabetes, age, and use of digoxin and calcium channel and beta-blockers. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based sample, SV and CO are more strongly related to FFM than other variables; increased FFM may be the primary determinant of increased SV and CO in obesity.},

  abstract = {Although inflammatory cytokines produced by activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential for early host defense against infection, they also mediate a vast array of pathologies, including autoimmune disease, hypersensitivity reactions, and sepsis. Thus, numerous regulatory mechanisms exist in parallel with proinflammatory pathways to prevent excessive release of these potent effector molecules. We report elucidation of a novel regulatory function for interleukin receptor--associated kinase (IRAK)-1 binding protein 1 (IRAK1BP1, also known as SIMPL) through quantitative trait locus mapping of the TLR response in wild-derived mouse strains. This gene emerged as a negative regulator of TLR2-mediated interleukin (IL)-6 production in MOLF/Ei mice, which expressed IRAK1BP1 mRNA in an allele-specific manner when crossed with the C57BL/6J strain. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and primary macrophages from two other wild-derived mouse strains also induced IRAK1BP1 mRNA by 4 hours after stimulation with agonists of various TLRs. Examination of its effects on IL-6 and other cytokines demonstrated that IRAK1BP1 regulates transcription of a specific subset of TLR-responsive genes, producing an overall antiinflammatory profile. Our results reveal that IRAK1BP1 is a critical factor in preventing dangerous overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines by the innate immune system and in influencing the specificity of TLR responses. Furthermore, these results show that the genetic diversity of wild-derived mouse strains makes them a valuable model of important human gene functions that have been lost in some laboratory-inbred strains.},

By using an unbiased forward genetic approach, we previously reported that IL-1R--associated kinase 1 binding protein 1 (IRAK1BP1) down-modulates Toll-like receptor-mediated transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines. To gain insights into the physiological relevance of the inhibitory role of IRAK1BP1 in inflammation, we generated mutant mice lacking IRAK1BP1. Here we report that IRAK1BP1 does not inhibit signaling pathways generally but rather changes the transcriptional profile of activated cells, leading to an increase in IL-10 production and promoting LPS tolerance. This shift in cytokine transcription correlates with an increased ratio of functional NF-{$\kappa$}B subunit dimers comprised of p50/p50 homodimers relative to p50/p65 heterodimers. The increase in nuclear p50/p50 was consistent with the ability of IRAK1BP1 to bind to the p50 precursor molecule and I{$\kappa$}B family member p105. We conclude that IRAK1BP1 functions through its effects on NF-{$\kappa$}B as a molecular switch to bias innate immune pathways toward the resolution of inflammation.},

Design Population based study. Setting UK. Participants 1 650 052 individuals registered with a general practice contributing to Clinical Practice Research Datalink and newly diagnosed with at least one CVD from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2019. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was incident diagnosis of CVD, comprising acute coronary syndrome, aortic aneurysm, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation or flutter, chronic ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, second or third degree heart block, stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, and unspecified), and venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). Disease incidence rates were calculated individually and as a composite outcome of all 10 CVDs combined and were standardised for age and sex using the 2013 European standard population. Negative binomial regression models investigated temporal trends and variation by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Results The mean age of the population was 70.5 years and 47.6\% (n=784 904) were women. The age and sex standardised incidence of all 10 prespecified CVDs declined by 19\% during 2000-19 (incidence rate ratio 2017-19 v 2000-02: 0.80, 95\% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.88). The incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke decreased by about 30\% (incidence rate ratios for acute coronary syndrome, chronic ischaemic heart disease, and stroke were 0.70 (0.69 to 0.70), 0.67 (0.66 to 0.67), and 0.75 (0.67 to 0.83), respectively). In parallel, an increasing number of diagnoses of cardiac arrhythmias, valve disease, and thromboembolic diseases were observed. As a result, the overall incidence of CVDs across the 10 conditions remained relatively stable from the mid-2000s. Age stratified analyses further showed that the observed decline in coronary heart disease incidence was largely restricted to age groups older than 60 years, with little or no improvement in younger age groups. Trends were generally similar between men and women. A socioeconomic gradient was observed for almost every CVD investigated. The gradient did not decrease over time and was most noticeable for peripheral artery disease (incidence rate ratio most deprived v least deprived: 1.98 (1.87 to 2.09)), acute coronary syndrome (1.55 (1.54 to 1.57)), and heart failure (1.50 (1.41 to 1.59)). Conclusions Despite substantial improvements in the prevention of atherosclerotic diseases in the UK, the overall burden of CVDs remained high during 2000-19. For CVDs to decrease further, future prevention strategies might need to consider a broader spectrum of conditions, including arrhythmias, valve diseases, and thromboembolism, and examine the specific needs of younger age groups and socioeconomically deprived populations.},

  abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: High-throughput metabolomics technologies in a variety of study designs have demonstrated a consistent metabolomic signature of overweight and type 2 diabetes. However, the extent to which these metabolomic patterns can be reversed with weight loss and diabetes remission has been weakly investigated. We aimed to characterise the metabolomic consequences of a weight-loss intervention in individuals with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We analysed 574 fasted serum samples collected within an existing RCT (the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial [DiRECT]) (N=298). In the trial, participating primary care practices were randomly assigned (1:1) to provide either a weight management programme (intervention) or best-practice care by guidelines (control) treatment to individuals with type 2 diabetes. Here, metabolomics analysis was performed on samples collected at baseline and 12 months using both untargeted MS and targeted 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Multivariable regression models were fitted to evaluate the effect of the intervention on metabolite levels. RESULTS: Decreases in branched-chain amino acids, sugars and LDL triglycerides, and increases in sphingolipids, plasmalogens and metabolites related to fatty acid metabolism were associated with the intervention (Holm-corrected p{$<$}0.05). In individuals who lost more than 9 kg between baseline and 12 months, those who achieved diabetes remission saw greater reductions in glucose, fructose and mannose, compared with those who did not achieve remission. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have characterised the metabolomic effects of an integrated weight management programme previously shown to deliver weight loss and diabetes remission. A large proportion of the metabolome appears to be modifiable. Patterns of change were largely and strikingly opposite to perturbances previously documented with the development of type 2 diabetes. DATA AVAILABILITY: The data used for analysis are available on a research data repository ( https://researchdata.gla.ac.uk/ ) with access given to researchers subject to appropriate data sharing agreements. Metabolite data preparation, data pre-processing, statistical analyses and figure generation were performed in R Studio v.1.0.143 using R v.4.0.2.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the general population, obesity is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, studies of patients with chronic disease suggest that overweight and obese patients may paradoxically have better outcomes than lean patients. We sought to examine the association of body mass index (BMI) and outcomes in stable outpatients with heart failure (HF). METHODS: We analyzed data from 7767 patients with stable HF enrolled in the Digitalis Investigation Group trial. Patients were categorized using baseline BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) as underweight (BMI {$<$}18.5), healthy weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9, overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9), and obese (BMI {$>$} or =30.0). Risks associated with BMI groups were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models over a mean follow-up of 37 months. RESULTS: Crude all-cause mortality rates decreased in a near linear fashion across successively higher BMI groups, from 45.0\% in the underweight group to 28.4\% in the obese group (P for trend {$<$}.001). After multivariable adjustment, overweight and obese patients were at lower risk for death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.96, and HR, 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.92, respectively), compared with patients at a healthy weight (referent). In contrast, underweight patients with stable HF were at increased risk for death (HR 1.21; 95\% CI, 0.95-1.53). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of outpatients with established HF, higher BMIs were associated with lower mortality risks; overweight and obese patients had lower risk of death compared with those at a healthy weight. Understanding the mechanisms and impact of the "obesity paradox" in patients with HF is necessary before recommendations are made concerning weight and weight control in this population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Loop diuretics are commonly prescribed in the community, not always to patients with a recorded diagnosis of heart failure (HF). The rate of HF events in patients prescribed loop diuretics without a diagnosis of HF is unknown. METHODS: This was a propensity-matched cohort study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics and Office of National Statistics in the UK. Patients prescribed a loop diuretic without a diagnosis of HF (loop diuretic group) between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2015 were compared with patients with HF (HF group)-analysis A, and patients with risk factors for HF (either ischaemic heart disease, or diabetes and hypertension-at-risk group)-analysis B. The primary endpoint was an HF event (a composite of presentation with HF symptoms, HF hospitalisation, HF diagnosis (analysis B only) and all-cause mortality). RESULTS: From a total population of 180\,384 patients (78\,968 in the loop diuretic group, 28\,177 in the HF group and 73\,239 in the at-risk group), there were 59\,694 patients, 22\,352 patients and 57\,219 patients in the loop diuretic, HF and at-risk groups, respectively, after exclusion criteria were applied. After propensity matching for age, sex and comorbidities, patients in the loop diuretic group had a similar rate of HF events as those in the HF group (71.9\% vs 72.1\%; HR=0.92 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.94); p{$<$}0.001), and twice as those in the at-risk group (59.2\% vs 35.7\%; HR=2.04 (95\% CI 2.00 to 2.08); p{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients prescribed a loop diuretic without a recorded diagnosis of HF experience HF events at a rate comparable with that of patients with a recorded diagnosis of HF; many of these patients may have undiagnosed HF.},

  abstract = {Background This study was designed to investigate the genetic evidence for repurposing of GLP1R (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor) agonists to prevent heart failure (HF) and whether the potential benefit exceeds the benefit conferred by more general glycemic control. Methods and Results We applied 2-sample Mendelian randomization of genetically proxied GLP1R agonism on HF as the main outcome and left ventricular ejection fraction as the secondary outcome. The associations were compared with those of general glycemic control on the same outcomes. Genetic associations were obtained from genome-wide association study summary statistics of type 2 diabetes mellitus (228~499 cases and 1~178~783 controls), glycated hemoglobin (n=344~182), HF (47,309 cases and 930~014 controls), and left ventricular ejection fraction (n=16~923). Genetic proxies for GLP1R agonism associated with reduced risk of HF (odds ratio per 1~mmol/mol decrease in glycated hemoglobin 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.64--0.87; P=1.69{\texttimes}10-4), and higher left ventricular ejection fraction (SD change in left ventricular ejection fraction per 1~mmol/mol decrease in glycated hemoglobin 0.22\%; 95\% CI, 0.03--0.42; P=0.03). The magnitude of these benefits exceeded those expected from improved glycemic control more generally. The results were similar in sensitivity analyses, and we did not find evidence to suggest that these associations were mediated by reduced coronary artery disease risk. Conclusions This genetic evidence supports the repurposing of GLP1R agonists for preventing HF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in people with overweight or obesity, but the effects of this drug on outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure are unknown. We report a prespecified analysis of the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2{$\cdot$}4 mg on ischaemic and heart failure cardiovascular outcomes. We aimed to investigate if semaglutide was beneficial in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a history of heart failure compared with placebo; if there was a difference in outcome in patients designated as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction compared with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; and if the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in patients with heart failure was related to baseline characteristics or subtype of heart failure. METHODS: The SELECT trial was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, event-driven phase 3 trial in 41 countries. Adults aged 45 years and older, with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater and established cardiovascular disease were eligible for the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a block size of four using an interactive web response system in a double-blind manner to escalating doses of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide over 16 weeks to a target dose of 2{$\cdot$}4 mg, or placebo. In a prespecified analysis, we examined the effect of semaglutide compared with placebo in patients with and without a history of heart failure at enrolment, subclassified as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or unclassified heart failure. Endpoints comprised MACE (a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death); a composite heart failure outcome (cardiovascular death or hospitalisation or urgent hospital visit for heart failure); cardiovascular death; and all-cause death. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03574597. FINDINGS: Between Oct 31, 2018, and March 31, 2021, 17\hphantom{,}604 patients with a mean age of 61{$\cdot$}6 years (SD 8{$\cdot$}9) and a mean BMI of 33{$\cdot$}4 kg/m2 (5{$\cdot$}0) were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide (8803 [50{$\cdot$}0\%] patients) or placebo (8801 [50{$\cdot$}0\%] patients). 4286 (24{$\cdot$}3\%) of 17\hphantom{,}604 patients had a history of investigator-defined heart failure at enrolment: 2273 (53{$\cdot$}0\%) of 4286 patients had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, 1347 (31{$\cdot$}4\%) had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and 666 (15{$\cdot$}5\%) had unclassified heart failure. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients with and without heart failure. Patients with heart failure had a higher incidence of clinical events. Semaglutide improved all outcome measures in patients with heart failure at random assignment compared with those without heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}72, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}60-0{$\cdot$}87 for MACE; 0{$\cdot$}79, 0{$\cdot$}64-0{$\cdot$}98 for the heart failure composite endpoint; 0{$\cdot$}76, 0{$\cdot$}59-0{$\cdot$}97 for cardiovascular death; and 0{$\cdot$}81, 0{$\cdot$}66-1{$\cdot$}00 for all-cause death; all pinteraction{$>$}0{$\cdot$}19). Treatment with semaglutide resulted in improved outcomes in both the heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HR 0{$\cdot$}65, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}49-0{$\cdot$}87 for MACE; 0{$\cdot$}79, 0{$\cdot$}58-1{$\cdot$}08 for the composite heart failure endpoint) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction groups (0{$\cdot$}69, 0{$\cdot$}51-0{$\cdot$}91 for MACE; 0{$\cdot$}75, 0{$\cdot$}52-1{$\cdot$}07 for the composite heart failure endpoint), although patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction had higher absolute event rates than those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. For MACE and the heart failure composite, there were no significant differences in benefits across baseline age, sex, BMI, New York Heart Association status, and diuretic use. Serious adverse events were less frequent with semaglutide versus placebo, regardless of heart failure subtype. INTERPRETATION: In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diease and overweight or obesity, treatment with semaglutide 2{$\cdot$}4 mg reduced MACE and composite heart failure endpoints compared with placebo in those with and without clinical heart failure, regardless of heart failure subtype. Our findings could facilitate prescribing and result in improved clinical outcomes for this patient group. FUNDING: Novo Nordisk.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Several studies have reported increasing obesity rates in the general population. Using data from the EUROASPIRE III survey, we investigated as to what extent the obesity epidemic affects the high priority group of coronary heart disease patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 8924 patients, who had experienced a recent coronary acute event, from 22 countries in Europe participating in the EUROASPIRE III study were gathered in 2006-2007. Eight centres had also participated in the earlier two EUROASPIRE surveys carried out in 1994-1995 and 1999-2000. In these eight centres, obesity prevalence in coronary patients had increased from 25 to 38\% during the past decade. The most recent survey shows that obesity is more prevalent in women (45 vs. 32\% in men) and is a major health problem across all the 22 countries. Only 18\% of all the patients were found to reach a body mass index below 25 kg/m whereas 53\% were diagnosed with central obesity. Since their hospital discharge, only half of the obese patients reported to have followed the dietary recommendations and 48\% reported engagement in more physical activity. Only 13\% of the patients who were overweight at the time of the coronary event reached the target of {$>$}or=5\% weight loss whereas 21\% of them presented with a weight gain of 5\% or more. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of obesity is still increasing and reaching epidemic proportions in the high priority group of coronary patients all over Europe. Patients' awareness and current management of obesity seems inadequate. More intensive programs focusing on diet and especially physical activity are urgently required.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Few investigations have been conducted to identify genetic determinants of common, polygenetic forms of heart failure (HF), and only a limited number of these genetic associations have been validated by multiple groups. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a case-control study to further investigate the potential impact of 14 previously reported candidate genes on the risk of HF and specific HF sub-types. We also performed an exploratory genome-wide study. We included 799 patients with HF and 1529 controls. After adjusting for age, sex, and genetic ancestry, we found that the C allele of rs2234962 in BAG3 was associated with a decreased risk of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (odds ratio 0.42, 95\% confidence interval 0.25-0.68, P~=~0.0005), consistent with a previous report. No association for the other primary variants or exploratory genome-wide study was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide independent replication for the association between a common coding variant (rs2234962) in BAG3 and the risk of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.},

  abstract = {Identification of therapeutic targets from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) requires insights into downstream functional consequences. We harmonized 8,613 RNA-sequencing samples from 14 brain datasets to create the MetaBrain resource and performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) meta-analyses in multiple brain region- and ancestry-specific datasets (n\,{$\leq$}\,2,759). Many of the 16,169 cortex cis-eQTLs were tissue-dependent when compared with blood cis-eQTLs. We inferred brain cell types for 3,549 cis-eQTLs by interaction analysis. We prioritized 186 cis-eQTLs for 31 brain-related traits using Mendelian randomization and co-localization including 40 cis-eQTLs with an inferred cell type, such as a neuron-specific cis-eQTL (CYP24A1) for multiple sclerosis. We further describe 737 trans-eQTLs for 526 unique variants and 108 unique genes. We used brain-specific gene-co-regulation networks to link GWAS loci and prioritize additional genes for five central nervous system diseases. This study represents a valuable resource for post-GWAS research on central nervous system diseases.},

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the effects of rs6923761 GLP-1 receptor polymorphism on body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, basal GLP-1 levels and serum adipokine levels in na{\"i}ve patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. DESIGN: A sample of 104 na{\"i}ve patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 was enrolled in a prospective way. Basal fasting glucose, c-reactive protein (CRP), insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA), total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides concentration, basal GLP-1, HbA1c and adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin) levels were determined. Weights, body mass index, waist circumference, fat mass by bioimpedance and blood pressure measures were measured. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (47.1\%) had the genotype GG and 55 (52.9\%) diabetic subjects had the next genotypes; GA (44 patients, 42.3\%) or AA (11 study subjects, 10.6\%) (second group). In A allele carriers, basal GLP-1 levels were higher than non-carriers (2.9 {\textpm} 2.1 ng/ml; p {$<$} 0.05). No differences were detected between both genotype groups. CONCLUSION: Our cross-sectional study revealed an association between the rs6923761 GLP-1 receptor polymorphism (A allele carriers) and basal GLP-1 levels in na{\"i}ve patients with diabetes mellitus type 2.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) is of utmost importance. Although genetic studies have identified AD-associated SNPs in APOE and other genes, genetic information has not been integrated into an epidemiological framework for risk prediction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP Stage 1), we identified AD-associated SNPs (at p {$<$} 10-5). We then integrated these AD-associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazard model using genotype data from a subset of 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), providing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for each participant. By combining population-based incidence rates and the genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age, and tested replication in multiple independent cohorts (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Center [NIA ADC], and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], total n = 20,680). Within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among APOE {$\varepsilon$}3/3 individuals, the PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10 y between the lowest and highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95\% CI 2.62-4.24, p = 1.0 {\texttimes} 10-22). In independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (ADGC Phase 2, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 {\texttimes} 10-26) and longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD (NIA ADC, Cochran-Armitage trend test, p = 1.5 {\texttimes} 10-10), and was associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles, p = 3.9 {\texttimes} 10-6, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score for neuritic plaques, p = 6.8 {\texttimes} 10-6) and in vivo markers of AD neurodegeneration (ADNI, volume loss within the entorhinal cortex, p = 6.3 {\texttimes} 10-6, and hippocampus, p = 7.9 {\texttimes} 10-5). Additional prospective validation of these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based cohorts is necessary before clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a PHS for quantifying individual differences in age-specific genetic risk for AD. Within the cohorts studied here, polygenic architecture plays an important role in modifying AD risk beyond APOE. With thorough validation, quantification of inherited genetic variation may prove useful for stratifying AD risk and as an enrichment strategy in therapeutic trials.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that hypertension is frequently associated with overweight/obesity even in kids and adolescents. Either conditions influence development of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH), through different biological and hemodynamic mechanisms: obesity is conventionally thought to elicit a coherent growth of LV chamber dimensions and myocardial wall thickness (eccentric LV geometry), whereas a more accentuated increase in wall-thickness (concentric LV geometry) is attributed to hypertension. While during youth these differences are visible, proportion of LV concentric geometry, the most harmful LV geometric pattern, sharply raises in obese individuals during middle age, and becomes the most frequent geometric patterns among obese-hypertensive individuals. Two conditions with elevated hemodynamic impact, severe obstructive sleep apnea and masked hypertension contribute to the development of such a geometric pattern, but non-hemodynamic factors, and specifically body composition, also influence prevalence of concentric LV geometry. Contrasting a general belief, it has been observed that adipose mass strongly influences LV mass, particularly in women, especially when fat-free mass is relatively deficient. Thus, though blood pressure control is mandatory for prevention and reduction of LVH in obese hypertensive patients, without reduction of visceral adiposity regression of LVH is difficult. Future researches should be addressed on (1) assessing whether LVH resulting from alteration of body composition carries the same prognosis as pressure overload LVH; (2) defining tissue characterization of the hypertrophic heart in obese-hypertensive patients; (3) evaluating whether assessment of hemodynamic loading conditions and biological markers can help defining management of the association of obesity with hypertension.},

METHODS: We assessed relations among reduced FFM, obesity and LV mass in a population with high prevalence of obesity. Echocardiograms were performed in 2625 participants (1694 women, 1199 non-obese) of the Strong Heart Study cohort, free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. FFM was estimated by bioelectric impedance and analyzed in the non-obese subpopulation in relation with sex, BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). RFFMD was estimated in the obese subpopulation as the percent of observed/predicted FFM{$<$}20th percentile of the non-obese distribution. RESULTS: RFFMD was more frequent in women than men. LV mass indices (by either height(2.7) or FFM) were greater in obese with than in those without RFFMD, even after adjusting for sex and diabetes (both p{$<$}0.0001). The greater LV mass index in obesity with RFFMD was related mostly to increased LV diastolic dimension paralleling increased stroke index and cardiac index, in the presence of normal ejection fraction. RFFMD remained associated with greater LV mass index (p{$<$}0.0001) even independently of older age, greater BMI, higher systolic and lower diastolic blood pressure (all p{$<$}0.007), with negligible effect of sex, waist/hip ratio and diabetes. CONCLUSION: In obese SHS participants, RFFMD is associated with higher levels of LV mass, an effect related to adiposity more than central fat distribution and typical of female gender. Biological mechanisms of this association have to be better explored.},

Many of the genes implicated in these diseases encode proteins that regulate gene expression, such as chromatin-associated proteins, transcription factors, and RNA-binding proteins. The identification of targeted therapeutics for individuals carrying mutations in these genes remains a challenge, as the encoded proteins can theoretically regulate thousands of downstream targets in a considerable number of cell types. Here, we propose the application of a drug discovery approach originally developed for cancer called ``transcriptome reversal'' for these neurodevelopmental disorders.

Such associations are vulnerable to index event bias, by which selection of subjects according to disease status creates biased associations if common causes of incidence and prognosis are not accounted for. We propose an adjustment for index event bias using the residuals from the regression of genetic effects on prognosis on genetic effects on incidence. Our approach eliminates this bias when direct genetic effects on incidence and prognosis are independent, and otherwise reduces bias in realistic situations. In a study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we reverse a paradoxical association of the strong susceptibility gene MUC5B with increased survival, suggesting instead a significant association with decreased survival. In re-analysis of a study of Crohn's disease prognosis, four regions remain associated at genome-wide significance but with increased standard errors.},

  abstract = {Background The relative contribution of risk factors to the development of heart failure remains controversial. Further, whether these contributions have changed over time or differ by sex is unclear. Few population-based studies have been performed. We aimed to estimate the population attributable risk (PAR) associated with key risk factors for heart failure in the community. Methods Between 1979 and 2002, 962 incident heart failure cases in Olmsted County were age and sex-matched to population-based controls using Rochester Epidemiology Project resources. We determined the frequency of risk factors (coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and smoking), odds ratios, and PAR of each risk factor for heart failure. Results The mean number of risk factors for heart failure per case was 1.9{\textpm}1.1 and increased over time (P{$<$}.001). Hypertension was the most common (66\%), followed by smoking (51\%). The prevalence of hypertension, obesity, and smoking increased over time. The risk of heart failure was particularly high for coronary disease and diabetes with odds ratios (95\% confidence intervals) of 3.05 (2.36-3.95) and 2.65 (1.98-3.54), respectively. However, the PAR was highest for coronary disease and hypertension; each accounted for 20\% of heart failure cases in the population, although coronary disease accounted for the greatest proportion of cases in men (PAR 23\%) and hypertension was of greatest importance in women (PAR 28\%). Conclusion Preventing coronary disease and hypertension will have the greatest population impact in preventing heart failure. Sex-targeted prevention strategies might confer additional benefit. However, these relationships can change, underscoring the importance of continued surveillance of heart failure.},

Risk factors for incident hospitalized heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) compared with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in women and differences by race/ethnicity are not well characterized. Methods and Results--- We prospectively evaluated the risk factors for incident hospitalized HFpEF and HFrEF in a multiracial cohort of 42\,170 postmenopausal women followed up for a mean of 13.2 years. Cox regression models with time-dependent covariate adjustment were used to define risk factors for HFpEF and HFrEF. Differences by race/ethnicity about incidence rates, baseline risk factors, and their population-attributable risk percentage were analyzed. Risk factors for both HFpEF and HFrEF were as follows: older age, white race, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and hypertension. Obesity, history of coronary heart disease (other than myocardial infarction), anemia, atrial fibrillation, and more than one comorbidity were associated with HFpEF but not with HFrEF. History of myocardial infarction was associated with HFrEF but not with HFpEF. Obesity was found to be a more potent risk factor for African American women compared with white women for HFpEF (P for interaction=0.007). For HFpEF, the population-attributable risk percentage was greatest for hypertension (40.9\%) followed by obesity (25.8\%), with the highest population-attributable risk percentage found in African Americans for these risk factors. Conclusions--- In this multiracial cohort of postmenopausal women, obesity stands out as a significant risk factor for HFpEF, with the strongest association in African American women.

After multivariable adjustment, COPD was associated with higher risks of heart failure hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.54), and the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (HR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.34), but not cardiovascular death (HR, 1.10; 95\% CI, 0.94-1.30), or all-cause mortality (HR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 0.99-1.31). COPD was also associated with higher risk of all cardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.31) and noncardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.29-1.64). The benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril was consistent in patients with and without COPD for all end points. Conclusions In PARADIGM-HF, COPD was associated with lower use of beta-blockers and worse health status and was an independent predictor of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular hospitalization. Sacubitril/valsartan was beneficial in this high-risk subgroup. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT01035255.},

  abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a well-studied incretin hormone receptor and target of several therapeutic drugs for type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity and, more recently, cardiovascular disease. Some signalling pathways downstream of GLP-1R may be responsible for drug adverse effects such as nausea, while others mediate therapeutic outcomes of incretin-based T2D therapeutics. Understanding the interplay between different factors that alter signalling, trafficking, and receptor activity, including biased agonism, single nucleotide polymorphisms and structural modifications is key to develop the next-generation of personalised GLP-1R agonists. However, these interactions remain poorly described, especially for novel therapeutics such as dual and tri-agonists that target more than one incretin receptor. Comparison of GLP-1R structures in complex with G proteins and different peptide and non-peptide agonists has revealed novel insights into important agonist-residue interactions and networks crucial for receptor activation, recruitment of G proteins and engagement of specific signalling pathways. Here, we review the latest knowledge on GLP-1R structure and activation, providing structural evidence for biased agonism and delineating important networks associated with this phenomenon. We survey current biased agonists and multi-agonists at different stages of development, highlighting possible challenges in their translational potential. Lastly, we discuss findings related to non-synonymous genomic variants of GLP1R and the functional importance of specific residues involved in GLP-1R function. We propose that studies of GLP-1R polymorphisms, and specifically their effect on receptor dynamics and pharmacology in response to biased agonists, could have a significant impact in delineating precision medicine approaches and development of novel therapeutics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals who have experienced a stroke, or transient ischemic attack, face a heightened risk of future cardiovascular events. Identification of genetic and molecular risk factors for subsequent cardiovascular outcomes may identify effective therapeutic targets to improve prognosis after an incident stroke. METHODS: We performed genome-wide association studies for subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; ncases=51\,929; ncontrols=39\,980) and subsequent arterial ischemic stroke (AIS; ncases=45\,120; ncontrols=46\,789) after the first incident stroke within the Million Veteran Program and UK Biobank. We then used genetic variants associated with proteins (protein quantitative trait loci) to determine the effect of 1463 plasma protein abundances on subsequent MACE using Mendelian randomization. RESULTS: Two variants were significantly associated with subsequent cardiovascular events: rs76472767 near gene RNF220 (odds ratio, 0.75 [95\% CI, 0.64--0.85]; P=3.69{\texttimes}10-8) with subsequent AIS and rs13294166 near gene LINC01492 (odds ratio, 1.52 [95\% CI, 1.37--1.67]; P=3.77{\texttimes}10-8) with subsequent MACE. Using Mendelian randomization, we identified 2 proteins with an effect on subsequent MACE after a stroke: CCL27 ([C-C motif chemokine 27], effect odds ratio, 0.77 [95\% CI, 0.66--0.88]; adjusted P=0.05) and TNFRSF14 ([tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 14], effect odds ratio, 1.42 [95\% CI, 1.24--1.60]; adjusted P=0.006). These proteins are not associated with incident AIS and are implicated to have a role in inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that 2 proteins with little effect on incident stroke appear to influence subsequent MACE after incident AIS. These associations suggest that inflammation is a contributing factor to subsequent MACE outcomes after incident AIS and highlights potential novel targets.},

  abstract = {Data generated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are growing fast with the linkage of biobank samples to health records, and expanding capture of high-dimensional molecular phenotypes. However the utility of these efforts can only be fully realised if their complete results are collected from their heterogeneous sources and formats, harmonised and made programmatically accessible. Here we present the OpenGWAS database, an open source, open access, scalable and high-performance cloud-based data infrastructure that imports and publishes complete GWAS summary datasets and metadata for the scientific community. Our import pipeline harmonises these datasets against dbSNP and the human genome reference sequence, generates summary reports and standardises the format of results and metadata. Users can access the data via a website, an application programming interface, R and Python packages, and also as downloadable files that can be rapidly queried in high performance computing environments. OpenGWAS currently contains 126 billion genetic associations from 14,582 complete GWAS datasets representing a range of different human phenotypes and disease outcomes across different populations. We developed R and Python packages to serve as conduits between these GWAS data sources and a range of available analytical tools, enabling Mendelian randomization, genetic colocalisation analysis, fine mapping, genetic correlation and locus visualisation. OpenGWAS is freely accessible at https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk, and has been designed to facilitate integration with third party analytical tools.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure with a strong familial component. We performed an exome-wide array-based association study (EWAS) to assess the contribution of missense variants to sporadic DCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: 116,855 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were analyzed in 2796 DCM patients and 6877 control subjects from 6 populations of European ancestry. We confirmed two previously identified associations with SNVs in BAG3 and ZBTB17 and discovered six novel DCM-associated loci (Q-value{$<$}0.01). The lead-SNVs at novel loci are common and located in TTN, SLC39A8, MLIP, FLNC, ALPK3 and FHOD3. In silico fine mapping identified HSPB7 as the most likely candidate at the ZBTB17 locus. Rare variant analysis (MAF{$<$}0.01) demonstrated significant association for TTN variants only (P = 0.0085). All candidate genes but one (SLC39A8) exhibit preferential expression in striated muscle tissues and mutations in TTN, BAG3, FLNC and FHOD3 are known to cause familial cardiomyopathy. We also investigated a panel of 48 known cardiomyopathy genes. Collectively, rare (n = 228, P = 0.0033) or common (n = 36, P = 0.019) variants with elevated in silico severity scores were associated with DCM, indicating that the spectrum of genes contributing to sporadic DCM extends beyond those identified here. CONCLUSION: We identified eight loci independently associated with sporadic DCM. The functions of the best candidate genes at these loci suggest that proteostasis regulation might play a role in DCM pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subclinical inflammation is associated with an increased risk of heart failure and with adverse prognosis in patients with established heart failure. Yet, treatments specifically directed at reducing inflammation in patients with heart failure have not yet shown improved clinical outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that the interleukin-1{$\beta$} inhibitor canakinumab would prevent hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and the composite of HHF or heart failure-related mortality. METHODS: We randomized 10\,061 patients with prior myocardial infarction and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein {$\geq$}2 mg/L to canakinumab 50, 150, or 300 mg or placebo, given subcutaneously once every 3 months. In total, 2173 (22\%) reported a history of heart failure at baseline. We tested the hypothesis that canakinumab prevents prospectively collected HHF events and the composite of HHF or heart failure-related mortality. RESULTS: A total of 385 patients had an HHF event during a median follow-up of 3.7 years. Patients who had HHF were older, had higher body mass index, and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prior coronary bypass surgery. As anticipated, median (quartile 1, 3) baseline concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were higher among those who had HHF during follow-up than those who did not (5.7 [3.5, 9.9] mg/L versus 4.2 [2.8, 6.9] mg/L, respectively; P{$<$}0.0001). The unadjusted hazard ratios for HHF with each dose of canakinumab compared with placebo were 1.04 (95\% CI, 0.79-1.36) for 50 mg, 0.86 (95\% CI, 0.65-1.13) for 150 mg, and 0.76 (95\% CI, 0.57-1.01) for 300 mg ( P for trend=0.025). The composite of HHF or heart failure-related mortality was also reduced by canakinumab, with unadjusted hazard ratios of 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.78-1.29) for 50 mg, 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.68-1.13) for 150 mg, and 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.60-1.02) for 300 mg ( P for trend=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: These randomized double-blind placebo-controlled data suggest that therapy with canakinumab, an interleukin-1{$\beta$} inhibitor, is related to a dose-dependent reduction in HHF and the composite of HHF or heart failure-related mortality in a population of patients with prior myocardial infarction and elevations in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between adiposity and cardiometabolic traits is well known from epidemiological studies. Whilst the causal relationship is clear for some of these traits, for others it is not. We aimed to determine whether adiposity is causally related to various cardiometabolic traits using the Mendelian randomization approach. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the adiposity-associated variant rs9939609 at the FTO locus as an instrumental variable (IV) for body mass index (BMI) in a Mendelian randomization design. Thirty-six population-based studies of individuals of European descent contributed to the analyses. Age- and sex-adjusted regression models were fitted to test for association between (i) rs9939609 and BMI (n{$\mkern1mu$} ={$\mkern1mu$} 198,502), (ii) rs9939609 and 24 traits, and (iii) BMI and 24 traits. The causal effect of BMI on the outcome measures was quantified by IV estimators. The estimators were compared to the BMI-trait associations derived from the same individuals. In the IV analysis, we demonstrated novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and incident heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.19 per BMI-unit increase; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.39) and replicated earlier reports of a causal association with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (odds ratio for IV estimator, 1.1-1.4; all p {$<$} 0.05). For quantitative traits, our results provide novel evidence for a causal effect of adiposity on the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and confirm previous reports of a causal effect of adiposity on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, 2-h post-load glucose from the oral glucose tolerance test, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (all p {$<$} 0.05). The estimated causal effects were in agreement with traditional observational measures in all instances except for type 2 diabetes, where the causal estimate was larger than the observational estimate (p{$\mkern1mu$} = {$\mkern1mu$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and heart failure as well as between adiposity and increased liver enzymes.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, at least one crossover must occur per homologous chromosome pair to ensure normal progression of meiotic division and accurate chromosome segregation. However, the mechanism of crossover formation is not fully understood. Here, we report a novel recombination protein, C12ORF40/REDIC1, essential for meiotic crossover formation in mammals. A homozygous frameshift mutation in C12orf40 (c.232\_233insTT, p.Met78Ilefs*2) was identified in two infertile men with meiotic arrest. Spread mouse spermatocyte fluorescence immunostaining showed that REDIC1 forms discrete foci between the paired regions of homologous chromosomes depending on strand invasion and colocalizes with MSH4 and later with MLH1 at the crossover sites. Redic1 knock-in (KI) mice homozygous for mutation c.232\_233insTT are infertile in both sexes due to insufficient crossovers and consequent meiotic arrest, which is also observed in our patients. The foci of MSH4 and TEX11, markers of recombination intermediates, are significantly reduced numerically in the spermatocytes of Redic1 KI mice. More importantly, our biochemical results show that the N-terminus of REDIC1 binds branched DNAs present in recombination intermediates, while the identified mutation impairs this interaction. Thus, our findings reveal a crucial role for C12ORF40/REDIC1 in meiotic crossover formation by stabilizing the recombination intermediates, providing prospective molecular targets for the clinical diagnosis and therapy of infertility.},

  abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the associations between metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and different types of incident cardiovascular events in a contemporary population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients discharged from French hospitals in 2013 with at least 5\,years of follow-up and without a history of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; myocardial infarction, heart failure [HF], ischaemic stroke or cardiovascular death [MACE-HF]) or underweight/malnutrition were identified. They were categorized by phenotypes defined by obesity and three metabolic abnormalities (diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia). Hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular events during follow-up were adjusted on age, sex and smoking status at baseline. RESULTS: In total, 2\,873\,039 individuals were included in the analysis, among whom 272\,838 (9.5\%) had obesity. During a mean follow-up of 4.9\,years, when pooling men and women, individuals with MHO had a higher risk of MACE-HF (multivariate-adjusted HR 1.22, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-1.24), new-onset HF (HR 1.34, 95\% CI 1.31-1.37) and atrial fibrillation (AF; HR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.30-1.37) compared with individuals with no obesity and zero metabolic abnormalities. By contrast, risks were not higher for myocardial infarction (HR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.87-0.98), ischaemic stroke (HR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.88-0.98) and cardiovascular death (HR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.93-1.04). MHO in men was associated with a higher risk of clinical events compared with metabolically healthy men of normal weight (HR 1.12-1.80), while women with MHO had a lower risk for most events than metabolically healthy women of normal weight (HR 0.49-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: In a large and contemporary analysis of patients seen in French hospitals, individuals with MHO did not have a higher risk of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or cardiovascular death than metabolically healthy individuals with no obesity. By contrast, they had a higher risk of new-onset HF and new-onset AF. However, notable differences were observed in men and women in the sex-stratified analysis.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical practice varies widely in the dosing and administration of loop diuretics for patients hospitalized with heart failure. Current guidelines are based primarily on expert opinion, although several small studies have suggested that continuous infusion is more effective than bolus administration in promoting diuresis and reducing the likelihood of renal dysfunction. Felker and colleagues conducted the Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation trial to evaluate various diuretic strategies for acute decompensated heart failure. The Study: The trial prospectively examined diuretic doses and administration modes in 308 patients requiring hospitalization for acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, despite having been on an oral loop diuretic for at least one month. Patients were excluded if they required intravenous vasodilators or inotropic agents other than digoxin, had hypotension, or had a serum creatinine level greater than 3.0 mg per dL (265.2 {$\mu$}mol per L). Patients were randomized to receive intravenous furosemide, which varied along two interventions: (1) low versus high dose (total daily dose either equivalent to or 2.5 times greater than the patient's previous daily loop diuretic dose, respectively); (2) and method of administration (continuous infusion versus boluses every 12 hours). The interventions were continued for up to 72 hours, with the treating physician having the option at 48 hours to adjust treatment if clinically warranted. Patients were monitored for 60 days after admission. The primary study outcomes included patients' global assessment of their symptoms, and changes in serum creatinine levels over the first 72 hours. Results: Regardless of intervention, no differences were seen between the groups with regard to median hospital length of stay, 60-day mortality, rehospitalization, or emergency department visits. Similarly, there were no differences in patients' reported symptoms or in mean changes in creatinine level. Patients receiving high-dose furosemide were more likely to be changed to oral diuretics at 48 hours than those assigned to the low-dose strategy (31 versus 17 percent; P {\textexclamdown}.001). They also had greater levels of fluid loss. High-dose furosemide was associated with a greater likelihood of a transient increase in serum creatinine of more than 0.3 mg per dL (26.52 {$\mu$}mol per L) during the initial 72 hours of treatment (23 versus 14 percent in the low-dose group; P =.04), which had resolved by day 60. Conclusion: In patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours when intravenous loop diuretics were given via bolus versus continuous infusion, or with a low-dose versus high-dose strategy. {\copyright} 2012 American Academy of Family Physicians.},

  abstract = {Despite overweight/obesity being a well-known cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, high body mass index (BMI) has been suggested to be associated with longer survival in patients with heart failure (HF). Data on large populations are lacking, as well as whether this advantage might be consistent across the ejection fraction (EF) spectrum, i.e. reduced (HFrEF), mildly reduced (HFmrEF) and preserved (HFpEF, where obesity may have a greater causative role).To assess the association between BMI and outcomes in a large and unselected contemporary cohort of patients with HF across the EF spectrum.Patients with HF registered in the Swedish HF Registry (SwedeHF) between May 2000 and December 2021, with no missing values for EF and BMI, were selected. Linkage with the Cause of Death Registry and the National Patient Registry provided data on mortality, hospitalizations and comorbidities. Patients were categorised according to BMI class (underweight \&lt;18.5 kg/m2; normal weight 18.5-24.9 kg/m2; overweight 25.0-29.9 kg/m2; obesity\&gt;30-34.9 kg/m2).The primary outcome was all-cause death, secondary outcomes were CV death and HF hospitalization (HHF). The associations between BMI categories and outcomes were analysed by univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, both in the whole cohort and according to EF classes; this association was also explored by modeling BMI as a continuous variable through restricted cubic splines. Missing data were handled by chained equation multiple imputation.69,874 patients (mean age 74 years, 36\% females) were included, of whom 3\% underweight, 35\% with normal weight, 35 \% overweight, obese 27\%. Figure 1 reports the proportions of the different BMI categories according to EF: obesity was significantly more common in HFpEF. Regardless of EF, obese patients were younger, with lower N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide, higher New York Heart Association class, and with diabetes and hypertension as compared with the other three BMI classes.Compared with normal weight, both overweight and obesity were independently associated with lower mortality risk, while underweight with higher mortality, with consistent results in HFrEF, HFmrEF and HFpEF; the same associations were found for CV death or all three EF classes, while underweight only was associated with HHF in HFrEF. When BMI was modelled as restricted cubic splines, a reverse J-shaped adjusted association was found between BMI and risk of all-cause death (Figure 2).HF patients with overweight and obesity had a lower mortality risk compared with patients with normal or underweight patients across all EF classes, at least up to BMI\&gt;40 kg/m2. Our results are consistent with the previously suggested potential survival benefit in overweight patients, calling for future research to understand this apparent paradox.Figure 1},

We apply our approach to gene expression data from several sources together with GWAS summary statistics for 48 diseases and traits (average N=169K), detecting significant tissue-specific enrichments (FDR{$<$}5\%) for 34 traits. In our analysis of multiple tissues, we detect a broad range of enrichments that recapitulate known biology. In our brain-specific and immune-specific analyses, significant enrichments include an enrichment of inhibitory over excitatory neurons for bipolar disorder but excitatory over inhibitory neurons for schizophrenia and body mass index. Our results demonstrate that our polygenic approach is a powerful way to leverage gene expression data for interpreting GWAS signal.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early identification of ambulatory persons at high short-term risk of death could benefit targeted prevention. To identify biomarkers for all-cause mortality and enhance risk prediction, we conducted high-throughput profiling of blood specimens in two large population-based cohorts. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 106 candidate biomarkers were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of non-fasting plasma samples from a random subset of the Estonian Biobank (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}9,842; age range 18-103 y; 508 deaths during a median of 5.4 y of follow-up). Biomarkers for all-cause mortality were examined using stepwise proportional hazards models. Significant biomarkers were validated and incremental predictive utility assessed in a population-based cohort from Finland (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}7,503; 176 deaths during 5 y of follow-up). Four circulating biomarkers predicted the risk of all-cause mortality among participants from the Estonian Biobank after adjusting for conventional risk factors: alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (hazard ratio [HR] 1.67 per 1-standard deviation increment, 95\% CI 1.53-1.82, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}5{\texttimes}10{$^{-31}$}), albumin (HR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.65-0.76, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2{\texttimes}10{$^{-18}$}), very-low-density lipoprotein particle size (HR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.62-0.77, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3{\texttimes}10{$^{-12}$}), and citrate (HR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.21-1.45, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}5{\texttimes}10{$^{-10}$}). All four biomarkers were predictive of cardiovascular mortality, as well as death from cancer and other nonvascular diseases. One in five participants in the Estonian Biobank cohort with a biomarker summary score within the highest percentile died during the first year of follow-up, indicating prominent systemic reflections of frailty. The biomarker associations all replicated in the Finnish validation cohort. Including the four biomarkers in a risk prediction score improved risk assessment for 5-y mortality (increase in C-statistics 0.031, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01; continuous reclassification improvement 26.3\%, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker associations with cardiovascular, nonvascular, and cancer mortality suggest novel systemic connectivities across seemingly disparate morbidities. The biomarker profiling improved prediction of the short-term risk of death from all causes above established risk factors. Further investigations are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms and the utility of these biomarkers for guiding screening and prevention.},

This exclusionary approach was applied to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to investigate the potential effects of smoking and preexisting illness on estimates of the attributable fractions of US deaths in 2000 that were associated with different levels of body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m2). Synthetic estimates were calculated by using postexclusion relative risks for BMI categories in place of BMI relative risks from the full sample, holding the relative risks for all other covariates constant. When the postexclusion relative risks were used, the attributable fractions of deaths associated with underweight and with higher levels of obesity increased slightly and the attributable fractions of deaths associated with overweight and with grade 1 obesity decreased slightly. The relative risks for BMI categories did not show large or systematic changes after simultaneous exclusion of ever smokers, persons with a history of cancer or cardiovascular disease, and persons who died early in the follow-up period or had their heights and weights measured at older ages. These analyses suggest that residual confounding by smoking or preexisting illness had little effect on previous estimates of attributable fractions from nationally representative data with measured heights and weights.},

Observed weight-mortality associations are sometimes thought to result from this bias. Evidence for the occurrence of such bias is weak and inconsistent, suggesting that either the analytical methods used have been inadequate or else illness-related weight loss is not an important source of bias. Deleting participants has been the most frequent approach to control possible bias. As implemented, this can lead to deletion of almost 90\% of all deaths in a sample and to deletion of more overweight and obese participants than participants with normal or below normal weight. Because it has not been demonstrated that the procedures used to adjust for reverse causation increase validity or have large or systematic effects on relative risks, it is premature to consider reverse causation as an important cause of bias. Further research would be useful to elucidate the potential effects and importance of reverse causation or illness-related weight loss as a source of bias in the observed associations between weight and mortality in cohort studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior studies on chronic systolic heart failure (HF) have demonstrated that body mass index (BMI) is inversely associated with mortality, the so-called obesity paradox. The aim of this study was to determine whether BMI influences the mortality risk in acute decompensated HF, a subject not previously studied. METHODS: The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry was analyzed for acute HF hospitalizations in 263 hospitals in the United States from October 2001 through December 2004. Patients with documented height and weight were divided into BMI (measured in kilograms per square meter) quartiles. Inhospital mortality by BMI quartile for all the patients and for those with reduced (n = 43,255) and preserved (n = 37,901) systolic function was assessed. RESULTS: Body mass index quartiles in the 108,927 hospitalizations were QI (16.0-23.6 kg/m2), QII (23.7-27.7 kg/m2), QIII (27.8-33.3 kg/m2), and QIV (33.4-60.0 kg/m2). Patients in the higher BMI quartiles were younger, had more diabetes, and had a higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Inhospital mortality rates decreased in a near-linear fashion across successively higher BMI quartiles. After adjustments for age, sex, blood urea nitrogen, blood pressure, creatinine, sodium, heart rate, and dyspnea at rest, BMI quartile still predicted mortality risk. For every 5-U increase in BMI, the odds of risk-adjusted mortality was 10\% lower (95\% CI 0.88-0.93, P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with HF, higher BMI was associated with lower inhospital mortality risk. The relationship between BMI and adverse outcomes in HF appears to be complex and deserving of further study.},

Approximately 9.2 million individuals aged 40-69 years who lived within 25 miles (40 km) of one of 22 assessment centers in England, Wales, and Scotland were invited to enter the cohort, and 5.5\% participated in the baseline assessment. The representativeness of the UK Biobank cohort was investigated by comparing demographic characteristics between nonresponders and responders. Sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics of the cohort were compared with nationally representative data sources. UK Biobank participants were more likely to be older, to be female, and to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas than nonparticipants. Compared with the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke, and to drink alcohol on a daily basis and had fewer self-reported health conditions. At age 70-74 years, rates of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence were 46.2\% and 11.8\% lower, respectively, in men and 55.5\% and 18.1\% lower, respectively, in women than in the general population of the same age. UK Biobank is not representative of the sampling population; there is evidence of a "healthy volunteer" selection bias. Nonetheless, valid assessment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be representative of the population at large.},

  abstract = {Background  Association between abdominal obesity and development of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) between the sexes is not completely understood.  Objectives  This study evaluated the association between abdominal obesity and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with HFpEF while performing a gender outcome comparison.  Methods  A post hoc analysis was undertaken from the American cohort of the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT). The primary outcome (all-cause mortality) and the secondary outcomes (cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for HF, stroke, and MI) were evaluated via Cox proportional hazards models to compare the hazard ratios (HRs) between sexes in HFpEF patients. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference of {$\geq$}102\,cm in men and {$\geq$}88\,cm in women.  Results  A total of 3320 HFpEF patients (1620 men [48.80\%] and 1700 women [51.20\%]) were included in the analysis. The mean follow-up period was 3.4 {\textpm} 1.7 years, with 503 patients dying during that time. After multivariable adjustment, abdominal obesity was significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in males (adjusted HR: 1.32; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.71; p = 0.038). Abdominal obesity was associated with hospitalization for HF in both male (adjusted HR: 1.39; 95\% CI: 1.01 to 1.93; p = 0.045) and female patients (adjusted HR: 1.15; 95\% CI: 1.18 to 3.28; p = 0.010).  Conclusions  Abdominal obesity is associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality in the male but not the female HFpEF population and is associated with increased risks of hospitalization for HF in both sexes.},

  abstract = {Genetic alterations in the LRRK2 gene, encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, are a common risk factor for Parkinson's disease. How LRRK2 alterations lead to cell pathology is an area of ongoing investigation, however, multiple lines of evidence suggest a role for LRRK2 in lipid pathways. It is increasingly recognized that in addition to being energy reservoirs and structural entities, some lipids, including neural lipids, participate in signaling cascades. Early investigations revealed that LRRK2 localized to membranous and vesicular structures, suggesting an interaction of LRRK2 and lipids or lipid-associated proteins. LRRK2 substrates from the Rab GTPase family play a critical role in vesicle trafficking, lipid metabolism and lipid storage, all processes which rely on lipid dynamics. In addition, LRRK2 is associated with the phosphorylation and activity of enzymes that catabolize plasma membrane and lysosomal lipids. Furthermore, LRRK2 knockout studies have revealed that blood, brain and urine exhibit lipid level changes, including alterations to sterols, sphingolipids and phospholipids, respectively. In human LRRK2 mutation carriers, changes to sterols, sphingolipids, phospholipids, fatty acyls and glycerolipids are reported in multiple tissues. This review summarizes the evidence regarding associations between LRRK2 and lipids, and the functional consequences of LRRK2-associated lipid changes are discussed.},

We then argue for a more integrated and thorough approach, providing a framework to do this in the context of HbA1c and diabetes. We conducted a literature search for MR studies that have instrumented diabetes and/or HbA1c. We also used data from the UK Biobank (UKB) (N = 349,326) to calculate instrument strength metrics that are key in MR studies (the F statistic for average strength and R2 for total strength) with two different methods (``individual-level data regression'' and Cragg-Donald formula). We used a 157--single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) instrument for diabetes and a 51-SNP instrument (with partition into glycemic and erythrocytic as well) for HbA1c. Our literature search yielded 48 studies for diabetes and 22 for HbA1c. Our UKB empirical examples showed that irrespective of the method used to calculate metrics of strength and whether the instrument was the main one or included partition by function, the HbA1c genetic instrument is strong in terms of both average and total strength. For diabetes, a 157-SNP instrument was shown to have good average strength and total strength, but these were both substantially lesser than those of the HbA1c instrument. We provide a careful set of five recommendations to researchers who wish to genetically instrument type 2 diabetes and/or HbA1c. In MR studies of glycemia, investigators should take a more integrated approach when selecting genetic instruments, and we give specific guidance on how to do this.},

Here, we present an ensemble machine-learning framework (machine learning with phenotype associations, MILTON) utilizing a range of biomarkers to predict 3,213 diseases in the UK Biobank. Leveraging the UK Biobank's longitudinal health record data, MILTON predicts incident disease cases undiagnosed at time of recruitment, largely outperforming available polygenic risk scores. We further demonstrate the utility of MILTON in augmenting genetic association analyses in a phenome-wide association study of 484,230 genome-sequenced samples, along with 46,327 samples with matched plasma proteomics data. This resulted in improved signals for 88 known (P\,{$<$}\,1\,{\texttimes}\,10-8) gene--disease relationships alongside 182 gene--disease relationships that did not achieve genome-wide significance in the nonaugmented baseline cohorts. We validated these discoveries in the FinnGen biobank alongside two orthogonal machine-learning methods built for gene--disease prioritization.

  abstract = {AIMS: Our objective was to better understand the genetic bases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a leading cause of systolic heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted the largest genome-wide association study performed so far in DCM, with 2719 cases and 4440 controls in the discovery population. We identified and replicated two new DCM-associated loci on chromosome 3p25.1 [lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs62232870, P\,=\,8.7 {\texttimes} 10-11 and 7.7 {\texttimes} 10-4 in the discovery and replication steps, respectively] and chromosome 22q11.23 (lead SNP rs7284877, P\,=\,3.3 {\texttimes} 10-8 and 1.4 {\texttimes} 10-3 in the discovery and replication steps, respectively), while confirming two previously identified DCM loci on chromosomes 10 and 1, BAG3 and HSPB7. A genetic risk score constructed from the number of risk alleles at these four DCM loci revealed a 3-fold increased risk of DCM for individuals with 8 risk alleles compared to individuals with 5 risk alleles (median of the referral population). In silico annotation and functional 4C-sequencing analyses on iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes identify SLC6A6 as the most likely DCM gene at the 3p25.1 locus. This gene encodes a taurine transporter whose involvement in myocardial dysfunction and DCM is supported by numerous observations in humans and animals. At the 22q11.23 locus, in silico and data mining annotations, and to a lesser extent functional analysis, strongly suggest SMARCB1 as the candidate culprit gene. CONCLUSION: This study provides a better understanding of the genetic architecture of DCM and sheds light on novel biological pathways underlying heart failure.},

  abstract = {Adipose tissue inflammation mediates the association between excessive body fat accumulation and several chronic inflammatory diseases. A high prevalence of obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation was observed not only in patients with cardiovascular conditions but also in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, abdominal aortic aneurysm, or cardiorenal syndrome. In addition to excessive caloric intake, other triggers promote visceral adipose tissue inflammation followed by chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation. The infiltration and accumulation of immune cells in the inflamed and hypertrophied adipose tissue promote the production of inflammatory cytokines, contributing to target organ damages. This comorbidity seems to delimit subgroups of individuals with systemic adipose tissue inflammation and more severe chronic inflammatory diseases that are refractory to conventional treatment. This review highlights the association between adipose tissue immune response and the pathophysiology of visceral adiposity-related chronic inflammatory diseases, while suggesting several new therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity at genomic loci encoding drug targets can be exploited by multivariable Mendelian randomization to provide insight on the pathways by which pharmacological interventions may affect disease risk. However, statistical inference in such investigations may be poor if overdispersion heterogeneity in measured genetic associations is unaccounted for. In this work, we first develop conditional F-statistics for dimension-reduced genetic associations that enable more accurate measurement of phenotypic heterogeneity. We then develop a novel extension for two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization that accounts for overdispersion heterogeneity in dimension-reduced genetic associations. Our empirical focus is to use genetic variants in the GLP1R gene region to understand the mechanism by which GLP1R agonism affects coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Colocalization analyses indicate that distinct variants in the GLP1R gene region are associated with body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses that were corrected for overdispersion heterogeneity suggest that bodyweight lowering rather than type 2 diabetes liability lowering effects of GLP1R agonism are more likely contributing to reduced CAD risk. Tissue-specific analyses prioritised brain tissue as the most likely to be relevant for CAD risk, of the tissues considered. We hope the multivariable Mendelian randomization approach illustrated here is widely applicable to better understand mechanisms linking drug targets to diseases outcomes, and hence to guide drug development efforts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Edoxaban is a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor with proven antithrombotic effects. The long-term efficacy and safety of edoxaban as compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation is not known. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial comparing two once-daily regimens of edoxaban with warfarin in 21,105 patients with moderate-to-high-risk atrial fibrillation (median follow-up, 2.8 years). The primary efficacy end point was stroke or systemic embolism. Each edoxaban regimen was tested for noninferiority to warfarin during the treatment period. The principal safety end point was major bleeding. RESULTS The annualized rate of the primary end point during treatment was 1.50\% with warfarin (median time in the therapeutic range, 68.4\%), as compared with 1.18\% with high-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 0.79; 97.5\% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.99; P{\textexclamdown}0.001 for noninferiority) and 1.61\% with low-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 1.07; 97.5\% CI, 0.87 to 1.31; P=0.005 for noninferiority). In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was a trend favoring high-dose edoxaban versus warfarin (hazard ratio, 0.87; 97.5\% CI, 0.73 to 1.04; P=0.08) and an unfavorable trend with low-dose edoxaban versus warfarin (hazard ratio, 1.13; 97.5\% CI, 0.96 to 1.34; P=0.10). The annualized rate of major bleeding was 3.43\% with warfarin versus 2.75\% with high-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.91; P{\textexclamdown}0.001) and 1.61\% with low-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.41 to 0.55; P{\textexclamdown}0.001). The corresponding annualized rates of death from cardiovascular causes were 3.17\% versus 2.74\% (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.01), and 2.71\% (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 0.96; P=0.008), and the corresponding rates of the key secondary end point (a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes) were 4.43\% versus 3.85\% (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 0.96; P=0.005), and 4.23\% (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.86 to 1.05; P=0.32). CONCLUSIONS Both once-daily regimens of edoxaban were noninferior to warfarin with respect to the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism and were associated with significantly lower rates of bleeding and death from cardiovascular causes.

  abstract = {Background-Oxidative stress may contribute to heart failure (HF) progression. Inhibiting xanthine oxidase in hyperuricemic HF patients may improve outcomes. Methods and Results-We randomly assigned 253 patients with symptomatic HF, left ventricular ejection fraction {$\leq$}40\%, and serum uric acid levels {$\geq$}9.5 mg/dL to receive allopurinol (target dose, 600 mg daily) or placebo in a double-blind, multicenter trial. The primary composite end point at 24 weeks was based on survival, worsening HF, and patient global assessment. Secondary end points included change in quality of life, submaximal exercise capacity, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Uric acid levels were significantly reduced with allopurinoLin comparison with placebo (treatment difference,-4.2 [-4.9,-3.5] mg/dL and-3.5 [-4.2,-2.7] mg/dL at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively, both P{\textexclamdown}0.0001). At 24 weeks, there was no significant difference in clinical status between the allopurinol-and placebo-treated patients (worsened 45\% versus 46\%, unchanged 42\% versus 34\%, improved 13\% versus 19\%, respectively; P=0.68). At 12 and 24 weeks, there was no significant difference in change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores or 6-minute walk distances between the 2 groups. At 24 weeks, left ventricular ejection fraction did not change in either group or between groups. Rash occurred more frequently with allopurinol (10\% versus 2\%, P=0.01), but there was no difference in serious adverse event rates between the groups (20\% versus 15\%, P=0.36). Conclusions-In high-risk HF patients with reduced ejection fraction and elevated uric acid levels, xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol failed to improve clinical status, exercise capacity, quality of life, or left ventricular ejection fraction at 24 weeks.},

  abstract = {Selection bias affects Mendelian randomization investigations when selection into the study sample depends on a collider between the genetic variant and confounders of the risk factor--outcome association. However, the relative importance of selection bias for Mendelian randomization compared with other potential biases is unclear.We performed an extensive simulation study to assess the impact of selection bias on a typical Mendelian randomization investigation. We considered inverse probability weighting as a potential method for reducing selection bias. Finally, we investigated whether selection bias may explain a recently reported finding that lipoprotein(a) is not a causal risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in individuals with previous coronary heart disease.Selection bias had a severe impact on bias and Type 1 error rates in our simulation study, but only when selection effects were large. For moderate effects of the risk factor on selection, bias was generally small and Type 1 error rate inflation was not considerable. Inverse probability weighting ameliorated bias when the selection model was correctly specified, but increased bias when selection bias was moderate and the model was misspecified. In the example of lipoprotein(a), strong genetic associations and strong confounder effects on selection mean the reported null effect on cardiovascular mortality could plausibly be explained by selection bias.Selection bias can adversely affect Mendelian randomization investigations, but its impact is likely to be less than other biases. Selection bias is substantial when the effects of the risk factor and confounders on selection are particularly large.},

However, the definition of its genetic architecture is limited by the technical challenge of capturing dynamic flow volumes from cardiac imaging at scale. We present DeepFlow, a deep-learning system to extract cardiac flow and volumes from phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A mixed-linear model applied to 37,653 individuals from the UK Biobank reveals genome-wide significant associations across cardiac dynamic flow volumes spanning from aortic forward velocity to aortic regurgitation fraction. Mendelian randomization reveals a causal role for aortic root size in aortic valve regurgitation. Among the most significant contributing variants, localizing genes (near ELN, PRDM6 and ADAMTS7) are implicated in connective tissue and blood pressure pathways. Here we show that DeepFlow cardiac flow phenotyping at scale, combined with genotyping data, reinforces the contribution of connective tissue genes, blood pressure and root size to aortic valve function.},

  abstract = {Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reflects kidney function. Progressive eGFR-decline can lead to kidney failure, necessitating dialysis or transplantation. Hundreds of loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for eGFR help explain population cross section variability. Since the contribution of these or other loci to eGFR-decline remains largely unknown, we derived GWAS for annual eGFR-decline and meta-analyzed 62 longitudinal studies with eGFR assessed twice over time in all 343,339 individuals and in high-risk groups. We also explored different covariate adjustment. Twelve genome-wide significant independent variants for eGFR-decline unadjusted or adjusted for eGFR-baseline (11 novel, one known for this phenotype), including nine variants robustly associated across models were identified. All loci for eGFR-decline were known for cross-sectional eGFR and thus distinguished a subgroup of eGFR loci. Seven of the nine variants showed variant-by-age interaction on eGFR cross section (further about 350,000 individuals), which linked genetic associations for eGFR-decline with age-dependency of genetic cross-section associations. Clinically important were two to four-fold greater genetic effects on eGFR-decline in high-risk subgroups. Five variants associated also with chronic kidney disease progression mapped to genes with functional in-silico evidence (UMOD, SPATA7, GALNTL5, TPPP). An unfavorable versus favorable nine-variant genetic profile showed increased risk odds ratios of 1.35 for kidney failure (95\% confidence intervals 1.03-1.77) and 1.27 for acute kidney injury (95\% confidence intervals 1.08-1.50) in over 2000 cases each, with matched controls). Thus, we provide a large data resource, genetic loci, and prioritized genes for kidney function decline, which help inform drug development pipelines revealing important insights into the age-dependency of kidney function genetics.},

  abstract = {Increased blood lipid levels are heritable risk factors of cardiovascular disease with varied prevalence worldwide owing to different dietary patterns and medication use1. Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels2, heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide3. Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS4--23 have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns24. Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65\,million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately\,295,000 individuals from 7\,ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for preventive and precision medicine25, we anticipate that increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate and equitable26 application of polygenic scores in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve outcome of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). A substantial proportion of patients, however, experience no benefit from ACE inhibitors because of previous intolerance. We aimed to find out whether candesartan, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, could improve outcome in such patients not taking an ACE inhibitor. METHODS: Between March, 1999, and March, 2001, we enrolled 2028 patients with symptomatic heart failure and left-ventricular ejection fraction 40\% or less who were not receiving ACE inhibitors because of previous intolerance. Patients were randomly assigned candesartan (target dose 32 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The primary outcome of the study was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for CHF. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: The most common manifestation of ACE-inhibitor intolerance was cough (72\%), followed by symptomatic hypotension (13\%) and renal dysfunction (12\%). During a median follow-up of 33.7 months, 334 (33\%) of 1013 patients in the candesartan group and 406 (40\%) of 1015 in the placebo group had cardiovascular death or hospital admission for CHF (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.77 [95\% CI 0.67-0.89], p=0.0004; covariate adjusted 0.70 [0.60-0.81], p{$<$}0.0001). Each component of the primary outcome was reduced, as was the total number of hospital admissions for CHF. Study-drug discontinuation rates were similar in the candesartan (30\%) and placebo (29\%) groups. INTERPRETATION: Candesartan was generally well tolerated and reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure and intolerance to ACE inhibitors.},

Whether these alterations are potentiated in the presence of obesity and hypertension, two conditions that also display neuroadrenergic abnormalities and markedly increase the risk of heart failure, is unknown. In 14 healthy control subjects (C; age, 55.1+/-3.0 years; mean+/-SEM), 13 lean hypertensive subjects (H), 15 obese normotensive subjects (O), 14 lean normotensive subjects with congestive heart failure (CHF, New York Heart Association class II), 14 lean hypertensive subjects with CHF (CHFH), 14 obese normotensive subjects with CHF (CHFO), and 13 obese hypertensive subjects with CHF (CHFOH), all age-matched with C, we measured mean blood pressure (Finapres), heart rate (ECG), and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA, microneurography) at rest and during baroreflex testing. Compared with C, body mass index was similarly increased in O, CHFO, and CHFOH, whereas mean blood pressure was similarly increased in HF, CHFH, and CHFOH, and left ventricular ejection fraction (echocardiography) was similarly reduced in CHF, CHFH, CHFO and CHFOH. Compared with C, MSNA was significantly increased in O, H, and CHF (43.0+/-2.2 versus 54.1+/-2.8, 53.1+/-2.5, and 57.4+/-2.8 bursts/100 heart beats, P{$<$}0.01). When O or H was combined with CHF, the MSNA increase was significantly more pronounced and maximal when O and H were concomitantly associated with CHF. Baroreflex sensitivity was reduced in O and H, with a further reduction in CHF and a minimal value in CHFOH. These data show that the sympathetic activation characterizing CHF is markedly potentiated when O and H alone or combined together are associated with a low cardiac output state and that this may depend on an arterial baroreflex impairment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although weight loss improves risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic disease, it is unclear whether intentional weight loss reduces mortality rates. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships among intention to lose weight, weight loss, and all-cause mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study using a probability sample of the U.S. population. SETTING: Interviewer-administered survey. PARTICIPANTS: 6391 overweight and obese persons (body mass index {$>$} or = 25 kg/m2) who were at least 35 years of age. MEASUREMENTS: Intention to lose weight and weight change during the past year were assessed by self-report in 1989. Vital status was followed for 9 years. Hazard rate ratios (HRRs) were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, smoking, health status, health care utilization, and initial body mass index. RESULTS: Compared with persons not trying to lose weight and reporting no weight change, those reporting intentional weight loss had a 24\% lower mortality rate (HRR, 0.76 [95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.97]) and those with unintentional weight loss had a 31\% higher mortality rate (HRR, 1.31 [CI, 1.01 to 1.70]). However, mortality rates were lower in persons who reported trying to lose weight than those in not trying to lose weight, independent of actual weight change. Compared with persons not trying to lose weight and reporting no weight change, persons trying to lose weight had the following HRRs: no weight change, 0.80 (CI, 0.65 to 0.99); gained weight, 0.94 (CI, 0.65 to 1.37); and lost weight, 0.76 (CI, 0.60 to 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Attempted weight loss is associated with lower all-cause mortality, independent of weight change. Self-reported intentional weight loss is associated with lower mortality rates, and weight loss is associated with higher mortality rates only if it is unintentional.},

  abstract = {The heart failure syndrome has first been described as an emerging epidemic about 25\,years ago. Today, because of a growing and ageing population, the total number of heart failure patients still continues to rise. However, the case mix of heart failure seems to be evolving. Incidence has stabilized and may even be decreasing in some populations, but alarming opposite trends have been observed in the relatively young, possibly related to an increase in obesity. In addition, a clear transition towards heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction has occurred. Although this transition is partially artificial, due to improved recognition of heart failure as a disorder affecting the entire left ventricular ejection fraction spectrum, links can be made with the growing burden of obesity-related diseases and with the ageing of the population. Similarly, evidence suggests that the number of patients with heart failure may be on the rise in low-income countries struggling under the double burden of communicable diseases and conditions associated with a Western-type lifestyle. These findings, together with the observation that the mortality rate of heart failure is declining less rapidly than previously, indicate we have not reached the end of the epidemic yet. In this review, the evolving epidemiology of heart failure is put into perspective, to discern major trends and project future directions.},

  abstract = {Background Emerging evidence shows allergic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and asthma, are risk factors of heart failure. However, the causal relationship between allergic diseases and heart failure is not clear. Methods We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis between allergic diseases and heart failure using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies from large GWAS consortia, with total sample size of 1.2 million. Independent instrumental variables for asthma and atopic dermatitis (P{$<$}1{\texttimes}10-5) were used as the exposure. We applied five models for the Mendelian randomization analysis. Finally, we performed the sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results. Results We have identified 55 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for asthma 54 independent SNPs for atopic dermatitis as our instrumental variables. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) analysis showed asthma was significantly associated with increased risk of heart failure (ORIVW = 1.04, 95\% CI, 1.01--1.07, P = 0.03). The Mendelian randomization analysis using the other four models also showed consistent results with the IVW analysis. Similarly, atopic dermatitis was also significantly associated with an increased risk of heart failure (ORIVW = 1.03, 95\% CI, 1.01--1.06, P = 0.01), consistent with the other four models. The sensitivity analysis showed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or results were driven by single SNPs. Conclusion Our study identified asthma and atopic dermatitis as a causal risk factor for heart failure and suggest inflammatory pathogenesis as a key factor contributing to the underlying mechanism. These findings emphasize the importance of asthma and allergy control in the prevention and management of heart failure.},

Whether this ``obesity paradox'' exists in patients with heart failure (HF) or can be modified by comorbidities is still controversial.

Paradoxically, in HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF), a high body mass index (BMI) appears to be beneficial. Approximately 50\% of HF patients have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFPEF). However, there are few data regarding the relationship between BMI and outcomes in HFPEF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and cardiovascular outcomes were assessed in the 4109 patients (mean age, 72 years; mean follow-up, 49.5 months) in the Irbesartan in HF with Preserved Ejection Fraction (I-PRESERVE) trial. Based on the BMI distribution, 5 BMI categories were defined: {$<$}23.5, 23.5 to 26.4, 26.5 to 30.9, 31 to 34.9, and {$\geq$}35 kg/m(2). Most patients (71\%) had a BMI {$\geq$}26.5, 21\% had a BMI between 23.5 and 26.4, and 8\% had a BMI {$<$}23.5 kg/m(2). Patients with higher BMI were younger, more often women, and more likely to have hypertension and diabetes and higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients with BMI of 26.5 to 30.9 kg/m(2) had the lowest rate for the primary composite outcome (death or cardiovascular hospitalization) and were used as reference group. After adjustment for 21 risk variables including age, sex, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, the hazard ratio for the primary outcome was increased in patients with BMI {$<$}23.5 (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.56; P=0.019) and in those with BMI {$\geq$}35 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.52; P=0.011) compared with the referent group. A similar relationship was found for all-cause mortality and for HF hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is common in HFPEF patients and is accompanied by multiple differences in clinical characteristics.

  abstract = {We have shown that 14q32 microRNAs are highly involved in vascular remodelling and cardiovascular disease. However, the 14q32 locus also encodes 41 `orphan' small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). We aimed to gather evidence for an independent role for 14q32 snoRNAs in human cardiovascular disease.We performed a lookup of the 14q32 region within the dataset of a genome wide association scan in 5244 participants of the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the snoRNA-cluster were significantly associated with heart failure. These snoRNA-cluster SNPs were not linked to SNPs in the microRNA-cluster or in MEG3, indicating that snoRNAs modify the risk of cardiovascular disease independently. We looked at expression of 14q32 snoRNAs throughout the human cardio-vasculature. Expression profiles of the 14q32 snoRNAs appeared highly vessel specific. When we compared expression levels of 14q32 snoRNAs in human vena saphena magna (VSM) with those in failed VSM-coronary bypasses, we found that 14q32 snoRNAs were up-regulated. SNORD113.2, which showed a 17-fold up-regulation in failed bypasses, was also up-regulated two-fold in plasma samples drawn from patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction directly after hospitalization compared with 30\,days after start of treatment. However, fitting with the genomic associations, 14q32 snoRNA expression was highest in failing human hearts. In vitro studies show that the 14q32 snoRNAs bind predominantly to methyl-transferase Fibrillarin, indicating that they act through canonical mechanisms, but on non-canonical RNA targets. The canonical C/D-box snoRNA seed sequences were highly conserved between humans and mice.14q32 snoRNAs appear to play an independent role in cardiovascular pathology. 14q32 snoRNAs are specifically regulated throughout the human vasculature and their expression is up-regulated during cardiovascular disease. Our data demonstrate that snoRNAs merit increased effort and attention in future basic and clinical cardiovascular research.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology (JCARE-CARD) studied prospectively the characteristics and treatments in a broad sample of patients hospitalized with worsening HF and the outcomes were followed for 2.1 years. Study cohort (n=2,488) was classified into 3 groups according to baseline BMI: {$<$}20.3kg/m(2) (n=829), 20.3-23.49kg/m(2) (n=832), and {$\geq$}23.5kg/m(2) (n=827). The mean BMI was 22.3{\textpm}4.1kg/m(2). Patients with higher BMI had lower rates of all-cause death, cardiac death, and rehospitalization because of worsening HF. After multivariable adjustment, the risk for all-cause death and cardiac death significantly increased with decreased BMI levels compared with patients with BMI {$\geq$}23.5kg/m(2). However, BMI levels were not associated with rehospitalization for worsening HF.

The study aimed to explore the impact of BMI on NT-proBNP concentrations and to examine whether other factors independent of or combined with BMI affect NT-proBNP values in patients with heart failure. Results A total of 293 participants were recruited. The mean age was 68.9\,{\textpm}\,13.2~years, males accounted for 46.4\% of the total cohort, the mean BMI was 23.1\,{\textpm}\,4.0~kg/m2, and the median NT-proBNP level was 3776 (1672--8806) pg/ml. There was an inverse relationship between BMI and log NT-proBNP (r\,=\,-~0.29; p\,{$<$}\,0.001, Spearman correlation). Each standard deviation increase in BMI (4~kg/m2) was associated with a 7\% decrease in NT-proBNP values in the total cohort. The independent inverse determinants of NT-proBNP other than BMI were male gender and eGFR, while the variables directly correlated to NT-proBNP were LVEF\,{$\leq$}\,40\% and NYHA class III--IV heart failure. Conclusions There is an inverse association between BMI and NT-proBNP levels. However, the correlation is weak, and there are other variables that have a significant impact on the NT-proBNP values as well. The NT-proBNP levels are still valuable in the diagnosis of heart failure regardless of BMI status.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is characterised by dysregulated, life-threatening immune responses, which are thought to be driven by cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). Genetic variants in IL6R known to down-regulate IL-6 signalling are associated with improved Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, a finding later confirmed in randomised trials of IL-6 receptor antagonists (IL6RAs). We hypothesised that blockade of IL6R could also improve outcomes in sepsis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and near IL6R to evaluate the likely causal effects of IL6R blockade on sepsis (primary outcome), sepsis severity, other infections, and COVID-19 (secondary outcomes). We weighted SNPs by their effect on CRP and combined results across them in inverse variance weighted meta-analysis, proxying the effect of IL6RA. Our outcomes were measured in UK Biobank, FinnGen, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI), and the GenOSept and GainS consortium. We performed several sensitivity analyses to test assumptions of our methods, including utilising variants around CRP and gp130 in a similar analysis. In the UK Biobank cohort (N = 486,484, including 11,643 with sepsis), IL6R blockade was associated with a decreased risk of our primary outcome, sepsis (odds ratio (OR) = 0.80; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.96, per unit of natural log-transformed CRP decrease). The size of this effect increased with severity, with larger effects on 28-day sepsis mortality (OR = 0.74; 95\% CI 0.47 to 1.15); critical care admission with sepsis (OR = 0.48, 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.78) and critical care death with sepsis (OR = 0.37, 95\% CI 0.14 to 0.98). Similar associations were seen with severe respiratory infection: OR for pneumonia in critical care 0.69 (95\% CI 0.49 to 0.97) and for sepsis survival in critical care (OR = 0.22; 95\% CI 0.04 to 1.31) in the GainS and GenOSept consortium, although this result had a large degree of imprecision. We also confirm the previously reported protective effect of IL6R blockade on severe COVID-19 (OR = 0.69, 95\% CI 0.57 to 0.84) in the COVID-19 HGI, which was of similar magnitude to that seen in sepsis. Sensitivity analyses did not alter our primary results. These results are subject to the limitations and assumptions of MR, which in this case reflects interpretation of these SNP effects as causally acting through blockade of IL6R, and reflect lifetime exposure to IL6R blockade, rather than the effect of therapeutic IL6R blockade. CONCLUSIONS: IL6R blockade is causally associated with reduced incidence of sepsis. Similar but imprecisely estimated results supported a causal effect also on sepsis related mortality and critical care admission with sepsis. These effects are comparable in size to the effect seen in severe COVID-19, where IL-6 receptor antagonists were shown to improve survival. These data suggest that a randomised trial of IL-6 receptor antagonists in sepsis should be considered.},

The emergence of GIP receptor (GIPR)--GLP1 receptor (GLP1R) co-agonists has fostered growing interest in the actions of GIP and GLP1 in metabolically relevant tissues. Here, we update concepts of how these hormones act beyond the pancreas. The actions of GIP and GLP1 on liver, muscle and adipose tissue, in the control of glucose and lipid homeostasis, are discussed in the context of plausible mechanisms of action. Both the GIPR and GLP1R are expressed in the central nervous system, wherein receptor activation produces anorectic effects enabling weight loss. In preclinical studies, GIP and GLP1 reduce atherosclerosis. Furthermore, GIPR and GLP1R are expressed within the heart and immune system, and GLP1R within the kidney, revealing putative mechanisms linking GIP and GLP1R agonism to cardiorenal protection. We interpret the clinical and mechanistic data obtained for different agents that enable weight loss and glucose control for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively, by activating or blocking GIPR signalling, including the GIPR--GLP1R co-agonist tirzepatide, as well as the GIPR antagonist--GLP1R~agonist AMG-133. Collectively, we update translational concepts of GIP and GLP1 action, while highlighting gaps, areas of uncertainty and controversies meriting ongoing investigation.},

GLP-1 is also implicated in outcomes of bariatric surgery, including appetite changes and T2D remission. Rare, potentially deleterious mutations in the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor gene (GLP1R) may, therefore, have important implications for pathogenesis of obesity and T2D, and for response to therapeutic interventions. Methods: A custom Axion genotyping array, including 117 rare predicted-deleterious GLP1R mutations (MAF{$<$}0.01 in gnomAD, CADD-PHRED {$>$}= 15), was used to screen 1714 unrelated adults with BMI {$>$}35 kg/m2 from the PMMO study. We also examined the UK Biobank (UKB) exome sequence dataset for rare, predicted-deleterious GLP1R variants and tested their effects on weight and glycaemia-related traits. Results: Thirty-four PMMO participants carried one of the 117 GLP1R variants screened (11 might have been expected using the sum of their gnomAD control MAFs). These 8 variants were associated with T2D in the UKB and subsequent gene-level analysis of the UKB exome sequence dataset (629/39,274 carriers) confirmed that rare GLP1R variants are associated with increased risk of T2D (OR=1.58), as well as with higher HbA1c levels (p= 0.039). Furthermore, our data highlight a potential interaction of these variants with body mass index. Conclusion: Rare, potentially deleterious GLP1R mutations is associated with increased T2D risk, as well as higher HbA1c in UKB participants without diabetes. Future studies should examine the implications of GLP1R mutations for response to GLP1 agonist treatment and explore the observed interactions with obesity in T2D risk, including in larger cohorts with obesity.},

  abstract = {Incretin hormone-based therapy in type 2 diabetes has been widely used, and dipepdityl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which prevent incretin degradation, have become popular oral hypoglycemic agents. The efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors varies from individuals, and factors determining responses to DPP-4 inhibitors have not been fully established. We aimed to investigate whether genetic variations in glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor are associated with responses to DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes.Genetic variations of rs3765467 in GLP-1 receptor were explored in 246 patients with type 2 diabetes who received DPP-4 inhibitors treatment for 24 weeks in addition to previous medication. Patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) {$>$} 7\% and who were naive to any DPP-4 inhibitors were enrolled. Responders were defined as those who showed a {$>$} 10\% reduction in HbA1c after DPP-4 inhibitor treatment.DPP-4 inhibitors improved glycemic parameters and lipid profiles. Compared to the major genotype (GG), a larger proportion of patients with the minor allele genotype (GA/AA) were responders (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.018), and also showing greater HbA1c reductions (1.3{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}1.1 vs 0.9{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}1.2\%; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.022). This genetic effect remained significant even after adjustment for other confounding factors (OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2.00, 95\% CI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.03-3.89).Polymorphism in the GLP-1 receptor may influence DPP-4 inhibitor response. Further studies in larger population will help determine the association between genetic variation and interindividual differences in DPP-4 inhibitor therapy.},

Bioinformatics analyses prioritize candidate causal genes at 52 loci, including CD52, and demonstrate that asthma-associated variants are enriched in regions of open chromatin in immune cells. Lastly, we show that a murine anti-CD52 antibody mimics the immune cell-depleting effects of a clinically used human anti-CD52 antibody and reduces allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity in mice. These results further elucidate the genetic architecture of asthma and provide important insight into the immunological and sex-specific relevance of asthma-associated risk variants.},

  abstract = {Heart failure exhibits remarkable pathophysiologic heterogeneity. A large body of evidence suggests that regardless of the underlying etiology, heart failure is associated with induction of cytokines and chemokines that may contribute to the pathogenesis of adverse remodeling, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{$\alpha$}, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 have been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Inflammatory cytokines modulate phenotype and function of all myocardial cells, suppressing contractile function in cardiomyocytes, inducing inflammatory activation in macrophages, stimulating microvascular inflammation and dysfunction, and promoting a matrix-degrading phenotype in fibroblasts. Moreover, cytokine-induced growth factor synthesis may exert chronic fibrogenic actions contributing to the pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In addition to their role in adverse cardiac remodeling, some inflammatory cytokines may also exert protective actions on cardiomyocytes under conditions of stress. Chemokines, such as CCL2, are also upregulated in failing hearts and may stimulate recruitment of pro-inflammatory leukocytes, promoting myocardial injury, fibrotic remodeling, and dysfunction. Although experimental evidence suggests that cytokine and chemokine targeting may hold therapeutic promise in heart failure, clinical translation remains challenging. This review manuscript summarizes our knowledge on the role of TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1, IL-6, and CCL2 in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and discusses the promises and challenges of targeted anti-cytokine therapy. Dissection of protective and maladaptive cellular actions of cytokines in the failing heart, and identification of patient subsets with overactive or dysregulated myocardial inflammatory responses are required for design of successful therapeutic approaches.},

We sought to address the hypothesis that some of the genetic factors which establish atherosclerosis may be distinct from those that predispose to vulnerable plaques and thrombus formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We carried out a genome-wide association study for MI in the UK Biobank (n{$\sim$}472~000), followed by a meta-analysis with summary statistics from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium (n{$\sim$}167~000). Multiple independent replication analyses and functional approaches were used to prioritize loci and evaluate positional candidate genes. Eight novel regions were identified for MI at the genome wide significance level, of which effect sizes at six loci were more robust for MI than for CAD without the presence of MI. Confirmatory evidence for association of a locus on chromosome 1p21.3 harbouring choline-like transporter 3 (SLC44A3) with MI in the context of CAD, but not with coronary atherosclerosis itself, was obtained in Biobank Japan (n{$\sim$}165~000) and 16 independent angiography-based cohorts (n{$\sim$}27~000). Follow-up analyses did not reveal association of the SLC44A3 locus with CAD risk factors, biomarkers of coagulation, other thrombotic diseases, or plasma levels of a broad array of metabolites, including choline, trimethylamine N-oxide, and betaine. However, aortic expression of SLC44A3 was increased in carriers of the MI risk allele at chromosome 1p21.3, increased in ischaemic (vs. non-diseased) coronary arteries, up-regulated in human aortic endothelial cells treated with interleukin-1{$\beta$} (vs. vehicle), and associated with smooth muscle cell migration in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: A large-scale analysis comprising {$\sim$}831~000 subjects revealed novel genetic determinants of MI and implicated SLC44A3 in the pathophysiology of vulnerable plaques.},

Nineteen independent SNPs were genome-wide significant (P {$<$} 5e-8) for the general addiction risk factor (addiction-rf), which showed high polygenicity. Across ancestries, PDE4B was significant (among other genes), suggesting dopamine regulation as a cross-substance vulnerability. An addiction-rf polygenic risk score was associated with substance use disorders, psychopathologies, somatic conditions, and environments associated with the onset of addictions. Substance-specific loci (9 for alcohol, 32 for tobacco, 5 for cannabis, 1 for opioids) included metabolic and receptor genes. These findings provide insight into genetic risk loci for substance use disorders that could be leveraged as treatment targets.},

Conventional analyses of this relationship are susceptible to omitted variable bias from variables that jointly influence both hospital admission and adipose status. We implement a novel quasi-Poisson instrumental variable model in a Mendelian randomization framework, identifying causal effects from random perturbations to germline genetic variation. We estimate the individual and joint effects of BMI, WHR, and WHR adjusted for BMI. We also implement multivariable instrumental variable methods in which the causal effect of one exposure is estimated conditionally on the causal effect of another exposure. Data on 310,471 participants and over 550,000 inpatient admissions in the UK Biobank were used to perform one-sample and two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses. The results supported a causal role of adiposity on hospital admissions, with consistency across all estimates and sensitivity analyses. Point estimates were generally larger than estimates from comparable observational specifications. We observed an attenuation of the BMI effect when adjusting for WHR in the multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses, suggesting that an adverse fat distribution, rather than a higher BMI itself, may drive the relationship between adiposity and risk of hospital admission.},

This study aimed to investigate the clinical features and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) derived myocardial strain and tissue characteristics in patients with HFpEF and comorbid obesity phenotype. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we included consecutive patients admitted to Fuwai hospital in China who underwent CMR. Patients with HFpEF or obesity were diagnosed with demographic data, clinical presentation, laboratory test, and echocardiography or CMR imaging. The key exclusion criteria were cardiomyopathy, primary valvular heart disease, and significant coronary artery disease. Participant data were obtained from the electronic medical records database or inquiry. Comparisons of clinical features and CMR derived structural and functional parameters amongst different groups were made using one-way analysis of variance, or {$\chi$}2 tests, and post hoc Bonferroni analysis where appropriate. Findings Between January 1, 2019 and July 31, 2021, 280 participants (108 patients with HFpEF and obesity, 50 patients with HFpEF and normal weight, 72 patients with obesity, and 50 healthy controls) were enrolled. Compared with patients with HFpEF and normal weight, patients with HFpEF and obesity were younger males, and had higher plasma volume, uric acid and hemoglobin levels, yet less often atrial fibrillation, and lower NT-proBNP levels, and had higher left ventricular mass index, end-diastole/systole volume index, lower left atrial volume index, and worse myocardial strains (all p~{$\leq~$}0.05), but no remarkable difference in late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) presence and extracellular volume fraction (ECV). After adjusting for age, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease, only global longitudinal strain (GLS, p~=~0.031) and early-diastolic global longitudinal strain rate (eGLSR, p~=~0.043) were considerably worse in patients with HFpEF and obesity versus patients with HFpEF and normal weight. Furthermore, early-diastolic strain rates showed no linear association with ECV in patients with HFpEF and obesity. Moreover, GLS demonstrated the highest diagnostic ability when compared with traditional CMR structural parameters and ECV to diagnose patients with HFpEF and obesity in the setting of obesity. Interpretation Higher systemic inflammation, and worse GLS and eGLSR may be the distinct features of obesity-related HFpEF phenotype; strains and ECV may represent different mechanisms of HFpEF with obesity, deserving further study.

  abstract = {Background--- Blood pressure (BP) responses to dietary sodium and potassium intervention and cold pressor test vary considerably among individuals. We aimed to identify novel genetic variants influencing individuals' BP responses to dietary intervention and cold pressor test. Methods and Results--- We conducted a genome-wide association study of BP responses in 1881 Han Chinese and de novo genotyped top findings in 698 Han Chinese. Diet-feeding study included a 7-day low-sodium (51.3 mmol/d), a 7-day high-sodium (307.8 mmol/d), and a 7-day high-sodium plus potassium supplementation (60 mmol/d). Nine BP measurements were obtained during baseline observation and each intervention period. The meta-analyses identified 8 novel loci for BP phenotypes, which physically mapped in or near PRMT6 (P=7.29{\texttimes}10--9), CDCA7 (P=3.57{\texttimes}10--8), PIBF1 (P=1.78{\texttimes}10--9), ARL4C (P=1.86{\texttimes}10--8), IRAK1BP1 (P=1.44{\texttimes}10-10), SALL1 (P=7.01{\texttimes}10--13), TRPM8 (P=2.68{\texttimes}10--8), and FBXL13 (P=3.74{\texttimes}10--9). There was a strong dose--response relationship between the number of risk alleles of these independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the risk of developing hypertension during the 7.5-year follow-up in the study participants. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of risk alleles, odds ratios (95\% confidence intervals) for those in the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 1.39 (0.97, 1.99), 1.72 (1.19, 2.47), and 1.84 (1.29, 2.62), respectively (P=0.0003 for trend). Conclusions--- Our study identified 8 novel loci for BP responses to dietary sodium and potassium intervention and cold pressor test. The effect size of these novel loci on BP phenotypes is much larger than those reported by the previously published studies. Furthermore, these variants predict the risk of developing hypertension among individuals with normal BP at baseline.},

The 2022 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with heart failure. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2020 to December 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant clinical trials and research studies, published through September 2021, were also considered. This guideline was harmonized with other American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines published through December 2021. Structure: Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Many recommendations from the earlier heart failure guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data. Value statements are provided for certain treatments with high-quality published economic analyses.},

  abstract = {Results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be used to infer causal relationships between phenotypes, using a strategy known as 2-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR) and bypassing the need for individual-level data. However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed MR-Base ({$<$}ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrbase.org"{$>$}http://www.mrbase.org{$<$}/ext-link{$>$}): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.},

  abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. While distinct clinical subtypes, defined by etiology and left ventricular ejection fraction, are well recognized, their genetic determinants remain inadequately understood. In this study, we report a genome-wide association study of HF and its subtypes in a sample of 1.9 million individuals. A total of 153,174 individuals had HF, of whom 44,012 had a nonischemic etiology (ni-HF). A subset of patients with ni-HF were stratified based on left ventricular systolic function, where data were available, identifying 5,406 individuals with reduced ejection fraction and 3,841 with preserved ejection fraction. We identify 66 genetic loci associated with HF and its subtypes, 37 of which have not previously been reported. Using functionally informed gene prioritization methods, we predict effector genes for each identified locus, and map these to etiologic disease clusters through phenome-wide association analysis, network analysis and colocalization. Through heritability enrichment analysis, we highlight the role of extracardiac tissues in disease etiology. We then examine the differential associations of upstream risk factors with HF subtypes using Mendelian randomization. These findings extend our understanding of the mechanisms underlying HF etiology and may inform future approaches to prevention and treatment.},

Despite recent advances, mortality and morbidity remain high and treatment innovation is challenged by limited understanding of aetiology in relation to disease subtypes. Here we harness the de-confounding properties of genetic variation to map causal biology underlying the HF phenotypic spectrum, to inform the development of more effective treatments. We report a genetic association analysis in 1.9 million ancestrally diverse individuals, including 153,174 cases of HF; 44,012 of non-ischaemic HF; 5,406 cases of non-ischaemic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and 3,841 cases of non-ischaemic HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We identify 66 genetic susceptibility loci across HF subtypes, 37 of which have not previously been reported. We map the aetiologic contribution of risk factor traits and diseases as well as newly identified effector genes for HF, demonstrating differential risk factor effects on disease subtypes. Our findings highlight the importance of extra-cardiac tissues in HF, particularly the kidney and the vasculature in HFpEF. Pathways of cellular senescence and proteostasis are notably uncovered, including \emph{IGFBP7} as an effector gene for HFpEF. Using population approaches causally anchored in human genetics, we provide fundamental new insights into the aetiology of heart failure subtypes that may inform new approaches to prevention and treatment.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We describe examples of selection bias in case-control studies (eg, inappropriate selection of controls) and cohort studies (eg, informative censoring). We argue that the causal structure underlying the bias in each example is essentially the same: conditioning on a common effect of 2 variables, one of which is either exposure or a cause of exposure and the other is either the outcome or a cause of the outcome. This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects ("selection bias") and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome ("confounding"). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.},

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), a biomarker of myocardial damage, is useful in characterizing subclinical CVD. We categorized obesity phenotypes and studied their associations with subclinical and clinical CVD and CVD subtypes, including heart failure (HF). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted cross-sectional and prospective analyses of 9,477 adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We used the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria and BMI to define obesity phenotypes as follows: metabolically healthy normal weight, metabolically healthy overweight, metabolically healthy obese, metabolically unhealthy normal weight, metabolically unhealthy overweight, and metabolically unhealthy obese. RESULTS At baseline (1990--1992), mean age was 56 years, 56\% were female, 23\% were Black, and 25\% had detectable hs-cTnT ({$\geq$}6 ng/L). Over a median of 17 years of follow-up, there were 2,603 clinical CVD events. Those with the metabolically healthy obese (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95\% CI 1.15--1.67), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (HR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.30--1.76), metabolically unhealthy overweight (HR 1.60, 95\% CI 1.41--1.82), and metabolically unhealthy obese (HR 2.14, 95\% CI 1.88--2.44) phenotypes had higher CVD risks in comparison with metabolically healthy normal weight. Detectable hs-cTnT ({$\geq$}6 ng/L) was associated with higher CVD risk, even among metabolically healthy normal-weight adults. Metabolically healthy obese adults had higher HF risk (HR 1.65, 95\% CI 1.30--2.09) in comparison with metabolically healthy normal weight. CONCLUSIONS The metabolically healthy obese phenotype was associated with excess burden of clinical CVD, primarily driven by an excess risk of HF. hs-cTnT was useful in stratifying CVD risk across all obesity phenotypes, even among obese individuals who appear otherwise metabolically healthy.},

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data in the Polygenic Score Catalog. SETTING: Polygenic Score Catalog, April 2022. Secondary analysis of 3915 performance metric estimates for 926 polygenic risk scores for 310 diseases to generate estimates of performance in population screening, individual risk, and population risk stratification. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals contributing to the published studies in the Polygenic Score Catalog. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection rate for a 5\% false positive rate (DR5) and the population odds of becoming affected given a positive result; individual odds of becoming affected for a person with a particular polygenic score; and odds of becoming affected for groups of individuals in different portions of a polygenic risk score distribution. Coronary artery disease and breast cancer were used as illustrative examples. RESULTS: For performance in population screening, median DR5 for all polygenic risk scores and all diseases studied was 11\% (interquartile range 8-18\%). Median DR5 was 12\% (9-19\%) for polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease and 10\% (9-12\%) for breast cancer. The population odds of becoming affected given a positive results were 1:8 for coronary artery disease and 1:21 for breast cancer, with background 10\,year odds of 1:19 and 1:41, respectively, which are typical for these diseases at age 50. For individual risk prediction, the corresponding 10\,year odds of becoming affected for individuals aged 50 with a polygenic risk score at the 2.5th, 25th, 75th, and 97.5th centiles were 1:54, 1:29, 1:15, and 1:8 for coronary artery disease and 1:91, 1:56, 1:34, and 1:21 for breast cancer. In terms of population risk stratification, at age 50, the risk of coronary artery disease was divided into five groups, with 10\,year odds of 1:41 and 1:11 for the lowest and highest quintile groups, respectively. The 10\,year odds was 1:7 for the upper 2.5\% of the polygenic risk score distribution for coronary artery disease, a group that contributed 7\% of cases. The corresponding estimates for breast cancer were 1:72 and 1:26 for the lowest and highest quintile groups, and 1:19 for the upper 2.5\% of the distribution, which contributed 6\% of cases. CONCLUSION: Polygenic risk scores performed poorly in population screening, individual risk prediction, and population risk stratification. Strong claims about the effect of polygenic risk scores on healthcare seem to be disproportionate to their performance.},

However, the impact, interplay, and underlying biological mechanisms among BMI, environment, genetics, and ancestry are not completely understood. To further examine these relationships, we utilized 427,509 calendar year-averaged BMI measurements from 100,418 adults from the single large multiethnic Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We observed substantial independent ancestry and nationality differences, including ancestry principal component interactions and nonlinear effects. To increase the list of BMI-associated variants before assessing other differences, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in GERA, with replication in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropomorphic Traits (GIANT) consortium combined with the UK Biobank (UKB), followed by GWAS in GERA combined with GIANT, with replication in the UKB. We discovered 30 novel independent BMI loci (P {$<$} 5.0 {\texttimes} 10-8) that replicated. We then assessed the proportion of BMI variance explained by sex in the UKB using previously identified loci compared to previously and newly identified loci and found slight increases: from 3.0 to 3.3\% for males and from 2.7 to 3.0\% for females. Further, the variance explained by previously and newly identified variants decreased with increasing age in the GERA and UKB cohorts, echoed in the variance explained by the entire genome, which also showed gene-age interaction effects. Finally, we conducted a tissue expression QTL enrichment analysis, which revealed that GWAS BMI-associated variants were enriched in the cerebellum, consistent with prior work in humans and mice.},

  abstract = {Background About one half of patients with HF have preserved rather than reduced ejection fraction (HFPEF; HFREF). The differences in risk factors predisposing to the two subtypes of HF are poorly understood. We sought to identify clinical predictors of new-onset HF, and to explore differences in HFPEF versus HFREF. Methods and Results We studied new-onset HF cases between 1981 and 2008 in Framingham Heart Study participants, classified into HFPEF and HFREF (EF {$>$} 45\% vs {$\leq$} 45\%). We used Cox multivariable regression to examine predictors of 8-year risk of incident HF, and competing-risks analysis to identify predictors that differed between HFPEF and HFREF. Among 6,340 participants (60 {\textpm} 12 years) with 97,808 person-years of follow up, 512 developed incident HF. Of 457 participants with LVEF evaluation at the time of HF diagnosis, 196 (43\%) were classified as HFPEF and 261 (56\%) as HFREF. Fourteen predictors of overall HF were identified. Older age, diabetes mellitus, and a history of valvular disease predicted both types of HF (p {$\leq$} 0.0025 for all). Higher BMI, smoking, and atrial fibrillation predicted HFPEF only, whereas male sex, higher total cholesterol, higher heart rate, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and left bundle branch block predicted risk of HFREF. Conclusions While multiple risk factors preceded overall HF, distinct clusters of risk factors determine risk for new-onset HFPEF versus HFREF. This knowledge may enable the design of clinical trials of targeted prevention and the introduction of therapeutic strategies for prevention of HF and its two major subtypes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate the role of obesity in the prognosis of patients with heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: Previous reports link obesity to the development of HF. However, the impact of obesity in patients with established HF has not been studied. METHODS: We analyzed 1,203 patients with advanced HF followed in a comprehensive HF management program. The patients were subclassified into categories of body mass index (BMI) defined as: underweight BMI {$<$}20.7 (n = 164), recommended BMI 20.7 to 27.7 (n = 692), overweight BMI 27.8 to 31 (n = 168) and obese BMI {$>$}31 (n = 179). This sample size allows the detection of small effects (0.02), with a power of 0.80 and an alpha level of 0.05 for comparing one-year survival between BMI groups. RESULTS: The four BMI groups had similar profiles in terms of ejection fraction (mean 0.22), sodium, creatinine and smoking. The obese and overweight groups had significantly higher rates of hypertension and diabetes, as well as higher levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. The four BMI groups had similar survival rates. Ejection fraction, HF etiology and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use predicted survival on univariate analysis (p {$<$} 0.01), although BMI did not. On multivariate analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise tests, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and serum sodium were strong predictors of survival (p {$<$} 0.05). Higher BMI was not a risk factor for increased mortality, but was associated with a trend toward improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of patients with advanced HF of multiple etiologies, obesity is not associated with increased mortality and may confer a more favorable prognosis. Further studies need to delineate whether weight loss promotion in medically optimized patients with HF is a worthwhile therapeutic goal.},

  abstract = {Although rare neurodevelopmental conditions have a large Mendelian component1, common genetic variants also contribute to risk2,3. However, little is known about how this polygenic risk is distributed among patients with these conditions and their parents nor its interplay with rare variants. It is also unclear whether polygenic background affects risk directly through alleles transmitted from parents to children, or whether indirect genetic effects mediated through the family environment4 also play a role. Here we addressed these questions using genetic data from 11,573 patients with rare neurodevelopmental conditions, 9,128 of their parents and 26,869 controls. Common variants explained around 10\% of variance in risk. Patients with a monogenic diagnosis had significantly less polygenic risk than those without, supporting a liability threshold model5. A polygenic score for neurodevelopmental conditions showed only a direct genetic effect. By contrast, polygenic scores for educational attainment and cognitive performance showed no direct genetic effect, but the non-transmitted alleles in the parents were correlated with the child's risk, potentially due to indirect genetic effects and/or parental assortment for these traits4. Indeed, as expected under parental assortment, we show that common variant predisposition for neurodevelopmental conditions is correlated with the rare variant component of risk. These findings indicate that future studies should investigate the possible role and nature of indirect genetic effects on rare neurodevelopmental conditions, and consider the contribution of common and rare variants simultaneously when studying cognition-related phenotypes.},

The mechanisms that uncouple adiposity from its cardiometabolic complications are not fully understood. Here, we identify 62 loci of which the same allele is significantly associated with both higher adiposity and lower cardiometabolic risk. Functional analyses show that the 62 loci are enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue, and for regulatory variants that influence nearby genes that affect adipocyte differentiation. Genes prioritized in each locus support a key role of fat distribution (FAM13A, IRS1 and PPARG) and adipocyte function (ALDH2, CCDC92, DNAH10, ESR1, FAM13A, MTOR, PIK3R1 and VEGFB). Several additional mechanisms are involved as well, such as insulin--glucose signalling (ADCY5, ARAP1, CREBBP, FAM13A, MTOR, PEPD, RAC1 and SH2B3), energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation (IGF2BP2), browning of white adipose tissue (CSK, VEGFA, VEGFB and SLC22A3) and inflammation (SH2B3, DAGLB and ADCY9). Some of these genes may represent therapeutic targets to reduce cardiometabolic risk linked to excess adiposity.},

Genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) is a statistical tool that aims to synthesize results from multiple independent studies to increase the statistical power and reduce false-positive findings of GWAS. However, it has been demonstrated that the aggregate data of individual studies are subject to inference attacks, hence privacy concerns arise when researchers share study data in GWAMA.In this article, we propose a secure quality control (SQC) protocol, which enables checking the quality of data in a privacy-preserving way without revealing sensitive information to a potential adversary. SQC employs state-of-the-art cryptographic and statistical techniques for privacy protection. We implement the solution in a meta-analysis pipeline with real data to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability on commodity machines. The distributed execution of SQC on a cluster of 128 cores for one million genetic variants takes less than one hour, which is a modest cost considering the 10-month time span usually observed for the completion of the QC procedure that includes timing of logistics.SQC is implemented in Java and is publicly available at https://github.com/acs6610987/secureqcSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In obesity, the excessive synthesis of aldosterone contributes to the development and progression of metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunctions. Obesity-induced hyperaldosteronism is independent of the known regulators of aldosterone secretion, but reliant on unidentified adipocyte-derived factors. We hypothesized that the adipokine leptin is a direct regulator of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression and aldosterone release and promotes cardiovascular dysfunction via aldosterone-dependent mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunostaining of human adrenal cross-sections and adrenocortical cells revealed that adrenocortical cells coexpress CYP11B2 and leptin receptors. Measurements of adrenal CYP11B2 expression and plasma aldosterone levels showed that increases in endogenous (obesity) or exogenous (infusion) leptin dose-dependently raised CYP11B2 expression and aldosterone without elevating plasma angiotensin II, potassium or corticosterone. Neither angiotensin II receptors blockade nor {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} adrenergic receptors inhibition blunted leptin-induced aldosterone secretion. Identical results were obtained in cultured adrenocortical cells. Enhanced leptin signaling elevated CYP11B2 expression and plasma aldosterone, whereas deficiency in leptin or leptin receptors blunted obesity-induced increases in CYP11B2 and aldosterone, ruling out a role for obesity per se. Leptin increased intracellular calcium, elevated calmodulin and calmodulin-kinase II expression, whereas calcium chelation blunted leptin-mediated increases in CYP11B2, in adrenocortical cells. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade blunted leptin-induced endothelial dysfunction and increases in cardiac fibrotic markers. CONCLUSIONS: Leptin is a newly described regulator of aldosterone synthesis that acts directly on adrenal glomerulosa cells to increase CYP11B2 expression and enhance aldosterone production via calcium-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, leptin-mediated aldosterone secretion contributes to cardiovascular disease by promoting endothelial dysfunction and the expression of profibrotic markers in the heart.},

A report summarizing quality metrics and the influence of available batch variables on the data are generated for the purpose of open disclosure. Where possible, we provide users flexibility in defining their own selection thresholds.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolite networks are suggested to reflect biological pathways in health and disease. However, it is unknown whether such metabolite networks are reproducible across different populations. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate similarity of metabolite networks in four German population-based studies. METHODS: One hundred serum metabolites were quantified in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam (n\,=\,2458), EPIC-Heidelberg (n\,=\,812), KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region) (n\,=\,3029) and CARLA (Cardiovascular Disease, Living and Ageing in Halle) (n\,=\,1427) with targeted metabolomics. In a cross-sectional analysis, Gaussian graphical models were used to construct similar networks of 100 edges each, based on partial correlations of these metabolites. The four metabolite networks of the top 100 edges were compared based on (i) common features, i.e. number of common edges, Pearson correlation (r) and hamming distance (h); and (ii) meta-analysis of the four networks. RESULTS: Among the four networks, 57 common edges and 66 common nodes (metabolites) were identified. Pairwise network comparisons showed moderate to high similarity (r\,=\,63-0.96, h\,=\,7-72), among the networks. Meta-analysis of the networks showed that, among the 100 edges and 89 nodes of the meta-analytic network, 57 edges and 66 metabolites were present in all the four networks, 58-76 edges and 75-89 nodes were present in at least three networks, and 63-84 edges and 76-87 edges were present in at least two networks. The meta-analytic network showed clear grouping of 10 sphingolipids, 8 lyso-phosphatidylcholines, 31 acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines, 30 diacyl-phosphatidylcholines, 8 amino acids and 2 acylcarnitines. CONCLUSIONS: We found structural similarity in metabolite networks from four large studies. Using a meta-analytic network, as a new approach for combining metabolite data from different studies, closely related metabolites could be identified, for some of which the biological relationships in metabolic pathways have been previously described. They are candidates for further investigation to explore their potential role in biological processes.},

  abstract = {Gliptins act by increasing endogenous incretin levels. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide receptor (GIPR) are their indirect drug targets. Variants of GLP1R and GIPR have previously been associated with the incretin effect. The aim of the present pilot study was to examine associations of the GLP1R and GIPR gene variants with the glycaemic response to gliptins. A total of 140 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes were followed-up 6\,months after initiation of gliptin treatment. GLP1R rs6923761 (Gly168Ser) and GIPR rs10423928 genotyping was performed using real-time PCR, with subsequent high-resolution melting analysis. The main study outcome was reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) after treatment. GLP1R Gly168Ser variant was significantly associated with reduction in HbA1c in an additive model ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.33, p\,=\,0.011). The mean reduction in HbA1c in Ser/Ser homozygotes was significantly lower compared with Gly-allele carriers [0.12\,{\textpm}\,0.23\% vs. 0.80\,{\textpm}\,0.09\% (1.3\,{\textpm}\,2.5\,mmol/mol vs. 8.7\,{\textpm}\,1.0\,mmol/mol); p\,=\,0.008]. In conclusion, GLP1R missense variant was associated with a reduced response to gliptin treatment. The genotype-related effect size of {$\sim$}0.7\% (8\,mmol/mol) is equal to an average effect of gliptin treatment and makes this variant a candidate for use in precision medicine.},

We aimed to gain deeper insights into the paradox through analyzing mortality relationships with several adiposity measures; assessing subgroups with type 2 diabetes, with coronary heart disease (CHD), with cancer, and by smoking status; and adjusting for several confounders.We studied the general UK Biobank population (N = 502,631) along with three subgroups of people with type 2 diabetes (n = 23,842), CHD (n = 24,268), and cancer (n = 45,790) at baseline. A range of adiposity exposures were considered, including BMI (continuous and categorical), waist circumference, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio, and the outcome was all-cause mortality. We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, smoking status, deprivation index, education, and disease history.For BMI, the obesity paradox was observed among people with type 2 diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio for obese vs. normal BMI 0.78 [95\% CI 0.65, 0.95]) but not among those with CHD (1.00 [0.86, 1.17]). The obesity paradox was pronounced in current smokers, absent in never smokers, and more pronounced in men than in women. For other adiposity measures, there was less evidence for an obesity paradox, yet smoking status consistently modified the adiposity-mortality relationship.The obesity paradox was observed in people with type 2 diabetes and is heavily modified by smoking status. The results of subgroup analyses and statistical adjustments are consistent with reverse causality and confounding.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational data have reported that being overweight or obese, compared to being normal weight, is associated with a lower risk for death - the "obesity paradox". We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate causal effects of body mass index (BMI) on mortality risks in people with coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or malignancy in whom this paradox has been often reported. METHODS: We studied 457,746 White British UK Biobank participants including three subgroups with T2DM (n~=~19,737), CHD (n~=~21,925) or cancer (n~=~42,612) at baseline and used multivariable-adjusted Cox models and MR approaches to describe relationships between BMI and mortality risk. RESULTS: Observational Cox models showed J-shaped relationships between BMI and mortality risk including within disease subgroups in which the BMI values associated with minimum mortality risk were within overweight/obese ranges (26.5-32.5~kg/m2). In all participants, MR analyses showed a positive linear causal effect of BMI on mortality risk (HR for mortality per unit higher BMI: 1.05; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.08), also evident in people with CHD (HR: 1.08; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.14). Point estimates for hazard ratios across all BMI values in participants with T2DM and cancer were consistent with overall positive linear effects but confidence intervals included the null. CONCLUSION: These data support the idea that population efforts to promote intentional weight loss towards the normal BMI range would reduce, not enhance, mortality risk in the general population including, importantly, individuals with CHD.},

The potential role of genetic variability of GLP-1R on body weight response to GLP-1 RAs in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: Fifty-seven obese women with PCOS (aged 30.7 {\textpm} 7.0, BMI 38.6 {\textpm} 5.3 kg/m(2)) were assigned to liraglutide 1.2 mg QD s.c. for 12 weeks and classified as strong responders regarding weight loss if they lost 5\% or more of their initial body weight. They were genotyped for common GLP-1R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6923761 and rs10305420. Changes of measures of obesity were measured before and at the end of the treatment. RESULTS: Twenty out of 57 subjects were strong responders and lost 7.38 {\textpm} 1.74 compared to 2.11 {\textpm} 2.17 kg lost in poor responders. Carriers of at least one polymorphic rs10305420 allele had poor treatment response compared to carriers of two wild type alleles (OR = 0.27, 95\% CI = 0.09-0.85, P = 0.025). Carriers of at least one polymorphic rs6923761 allele tended to have stronger treatment response compared to carriers of two wild type alleles (OR = 3.06, 95\% CI = 0.96-9.74, P = 0.058). Fasting glucose and glucose after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) comparably decreased in both groups when compared to baseline, whereas no within treatment differences were found in androgen profile. Gastrointestinal adverse events were transit and balanced between strong and poor responders. CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1R rs10305420 polymorphism explained some of the inter-individual differences in response to liraglutide regarding weight loss in obese PCOS women.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly recruited 459 white European subjects from 52 families (50\% women; mean age 45 years). LV structure was measured by M-mode and 2D echocardiography and LV function was measured by conventional Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Other measurements included blood pressure, anthropometric, and biochemical measurements. We estimated the heritability of LV traits while adjusting for covariables, including sex, age, body height and weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart rate. With full adjustment, heritability of LV mass was 0.23 (P= 0.025). The TDI-derived mitral annular velocities Ea and Aa showed moderate heritability (h(2)= 0.36 and 0.53, respectively), whereas the mitral inflow A peak had weak heritability (h(2) = 0.25) and the E peak was not heritable (h(2) = 0.11). We partitioned the total phenotypic correlation when it reached significance, into a genetic and an environmental component. The genetic correlations were 0.61 between the E and Ea peaks and 0.90 between the A and Aa peaks. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated moderate heritability for LV mass as well as the mitral annular Ea and Aa peaks. We also found significant genetic correlations between the E and Ea peaks and between the A and Aa peaks. Our current findings support the ongoing research to map and detect genetic variants that contribute to the variation in LV mass and other LV structural and functional phenotypes.},

In previous studies, enalapril improved survival in such patients. Methods: In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 8442 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40\% or less to receive either LCZ696 (at a dose of 200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily), in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial was designed to detect a difference in the rates of death from cardiovascular causes. Results: The trial was stopped early, according to prespecified rules, after a median followup of 27 months, because the boundary for an overwhelming benefit with LCZ696 had been crossed. At the time of study closure, the primary outcome had occurred in 914 patients (21.8\%) in the LCZ696 group and 1117 patients (26.5\%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio in the LCZ696 group, 0.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87; P{\textexclamdown} 0.001). A total of 711 patients (17.0\%) receiving LCZ696 and 835 patients (19.8\%) receiving enalapril died (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 0.93; P{\textexclamdown} 0.001); of these patients, 558 (13.3\%) and 693 (16.5\%), respectively, died from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.89; P{\textexclamdown} 0.001). As compared with enalapril, LCZ696 also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 21\% (P{\textexclamdown} 0.001) and decreased the symptoms and physical limitations of heart failure (P = 0.001). The LCZ696 group had higher proportions of patients with hypotension and nonserious angioedema but lower proportions with renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough than the enalapril group. Conclusions: LCZ696 was superior to enalapril in reducing the risks of death and of hospitalization for heart failure.},

  abstract = {Aims In people with heart failure (HF), a high body mass index (BMI) has been linked with better outcomes (`obesity paradox'), but there is limited evidence in community populations across long-term follow-up. We aimed to examine the association between BMI and long-term survival in patients with HF in a large primary care cohort. Methods We included patients with incident HF aged {$\geq$}45 years from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2000--2017). We used Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression and penalised spline methods to assess the association of pre-diagnostic BMI, based on WHO classification, with all-cause mortality. Results There were 47 531 participants with HF (median age 78.0 years (IQR 70--84), 45.8\% female, 79.0\% white ethnicity, median BMI 27.1 (IQR 23.9--31.0)) and 25 013 (52.6\%) died during follow-up. Compared with healthy weight, people with overweight (HR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.75 to 0.81, risk difference (RD) -4.1\%), obesity class I (HR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.73 to 0.80, RD -4.5\%) and class II (HR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.71 to 0.81, RD -4.5\%) were at decreased risk of death, whereas people with underweight were at increased risk (HR 1.59, 95\% CI 1.45 to 1.75, RD 11.2\%). In those underweight, this risk was greater among men than women (p value for interaction=0.02). Class III obesity was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with overweight (HR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.17 to 1.29). Conclusion The U-shaped relationship between BMI and long-term all-cause mortality suggests a personalised approach to identifying optimal weight may be needed for patients with HF in primary care. Underweight people have the poorest prognosis and should be recognised as high-risk.},

We aimed to examine the association between BMI and long-term survival in patients with HF in a large primary care cohort. Methods We included patients with incident HF aged {$\geq$}45 years from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2000--2017). We used Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression and penalised spline methods to assess the association of pre-diagnostic BMI, based on WHO classification, with all-cause mortality. Results There were 47 531 participants with HF (median age 78.0 years (IQR 70--84), 45.8\% female, 79.0\% white ethnicity, median BMI 27.1 (IQR 23.9--31.0)) and 25 013 (52.6\%) died during follow-up. Compared with healthy weight, people with overweight (HR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.75 to 0.81, risk difference (RD) -4.1\%), obesity class I (HR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.73 to 0.80, RD -4.5\%) and class II (HR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.71 to 0.81, RD -4.5\%) were at decreased risk of death, whereas people with underweight were at increased risk (HR 1.59, 95\% CI 1.45 to 1.75, RD 11.2\%). In those underweight, this risk was greater among men than women (p value for interaction=0.02). Class III obesity was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with overweight (HR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.17 to 1.29). Conclusion The U-shaped relationship between BMI and long-term all-cause mortality suggests a personalised approach to identifying optimal weight may be needed for patients with HF in primary care. Underweight people have the poorest prognosis and should be recognised as high-risk.},

  abstract = {Pharmacologic clinical trials for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction have been largely unsuccessful as compared to those for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Whether differences in the genetic underpinnings of these major heart failure subtypes may provide insights into the disparate outcomes of clinical trials remains unknown. We utilize a large, uniformly phenotyped, single cohort of heart failure sub-classified into heart failure with reduced and with preserved ejection fractions based on current clinical definitions, to conduct detailed genetic analyses of the two heart failure sub-types. We find different genetic architectures and distinct genetic association profiles between heart failure with reduced and with preserved ejection fraction suggesting differences in underlying pathobiology. The modest genetic discovery for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (one locus) compared to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (13 loci) despite comparable sample sizes indicates that clinically defined heart failure with preserved ejection fraction likely represents the amalgamation of several, distinct pathobiological entities. Development of consensus sub-phenotyping of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is paramount to better dissect the underlying genetic signals and contributors to this highly prevalent condition.},

DESIGN: Cross sectional survey and controlled intervention study. SETTING: City of Gothenburg and surrounding areas. Sweden. SUBJECTS: 41 obese patients treated with weight reducing gastric surgery, 31 obese patients treated conventionally, and 43 non-obese subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in left ventricular mass and relative wall thickness. RESULTS: Obese patients had higher blood pressure, greater left ventricular mass, and increased relative wall thickness than did matched non-obese control subjects. Obese subjects treated with gastric surgery had a substantial weight loss and a significant reduction in all variables when compared with conventionally treated obese subjects. Univariate and multivariate analysis of pooled data from the two groups of obese subjects showed that changes in relative wall thickness and left ventricular mass were more closely related to the change in weight than to the concomitant change in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Structural heart abnormalities occurring in conjunction with obesity diminish after weight loss. The regression in these structural aberrations is better predicted by the weight loss than by the accompanying reduction in blood pressure. To prevent or improve abnormalities of heart structure in obese people, weight control should be the primary goal; it should be regarded as at least as important as regulating blood pressure.},

This detailed knowledge of the genetic determinants of systemic metabolism has been pivotal for uncovering how genetic pathways influence biological mechanisms and complex diseases8--11. Here we present a genome-wide association study for 233 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in up to 136,016 participants from 33 cohorts. We identify more than 400 independent loci and assign probable causal genes at two-thirds of these using manual curation of plausible biological candidates. We highlight the importance of sample and participant characteristics that can have significant effects on genetic associations. We use detailed metabolic profiling of lipoprotein- and lipid-associated variants to better characterize how known lipid loci and novel loci affect lipoprotein metabolism at a granular level. We demonstrate the translational utility of comprehensively phenotyped molecular data, characterizing the metabolic associations of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Finally, we observe substantial genetic pleiotropy for multiple metabolic pathways and illustrate the importance of careful instrument selection in Mendelian randomization analysis, revealing a putative causal relationship between acetone and hypertension. Our publicly available results provide a foundational resource for the community to examine the role of metabolism across diverse diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) involving 1 million GWAS samples from dozens of population-based biobanks present a considerable computational challenge and are carried out by large scientific groups under great expenditure of time and personnel. Automating these processes requires highly efficient and scalable methods and software, but so far there is no workflow solution to easily process 1 million GWAS samples. RESULTS: Here we present BIGwas, a portable, fully automated quality control and association testing pipeline for large-scale binary and quantitative trait GWAS data provided by biobank resources. By using Nextflow workflow and Singularity software container technology, BIGwas performs resource-efficient and reproducible analyses on a local computer or any high-performance compute (HPC) system with just 1 command, with no need to manually install a software execution environment or various software packages. For a single-command GWAS analysis with 974,818 individuals and 92 million genetic markers, BIGwas takes {$\sim$}16~days on a small HPC system with only 7 compute nodes to perform a complete GWAS QC and association analysis protocol. Our dynamic parallelization approach enables shorter runtimes for large HPCs. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers without extensive bioinformatics knowledge and with few computer resources can use BIGwas to perform multi-cohort GWAS with 1 million GWAS samples and, if desired, use it to build their own (genome-wide) PheWAS resource.

  abstract = {Background The rate of disease progression is an important factor to consider regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD), as people with a rapid decline are considerably more likely to require additional care resources. The rate of progression in AD has been found to vary widely between individuals, with numerous factors driving this heterogeneity. In this project, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to investigate the presence of a genetic liability to faster progression in patients with AD. Methods A subset of 543 individuals with AD from the Cardiff MRC centre cohorts that have been assessed at multiple timepoints was used in this analysis. A progression score for each individual was approximated by a random slope from a random effects regression model of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) using all available MMSE measurements. The score was subsequently used in a GWAS of progression. Quality control analysis was performed following standard GWAS protocols resulting in 304,448 variants to be included in the analysis. Results The sample was 67.37\% female, with mean age at recruitment being 80.2 years. Mean MMSE was 17.03 at first assessment and 11.54 at last assessment, and mean number of assessments was 3.16. After correcting for multiple testing, no variant was found to be significantly associated with progression in this GWAS. Furthermore, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was not associated with progression. Conclusion Preliminary results show that, after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, no variant was significantly associated with progression in AD. Suggestive associated variants were found in chromosome 20:5843812 (p-value = 3.12 {\texttimes} 10-7), 1:62271962 (p-value = 6.30 {\texttimes} 10-7), 10:15452800 (p-value = 1.65 {\texttimes} 10-6) and 5:117646945 (p-value = 2.40 {\texttimes} 10-6). Moreover, ApoE genotype was not found to affect the rate progression, the lowest p-value in the ApoE region (19:44905791 - 19:44909393) being 0.23. This non-significant result might indicate that the genetic risk for accelerated cognitive decline within AD is separate from the genetic risk for developing AD. The sample size is one of the main limitations of this study. Replication in a larger dataset is necessary in order to validate these findings and uncover the presence of genetic variants that affect the rate of decline in AD.},

Here we identify 113 novel loci, reporting a total of 2,103 independent genetic signals (P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8) from the largest single-stage blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association study to date (n\,=\,1,028,980 European individuals). These associations explain more than 60\% of single nucleotide polymorphism-based BP heritability. Comparing top versus bottom deciles of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) reveals clinically meaningful differences in BP (16.9\,mmHg systolic BP, 95\% CI, 15.5-18.2\,mmHg, P\,=\,2.22\,{\texttimes}\,10-126) and more than a sevenfold higher odds of hypertension risk (odds ratio, 7.33; 95\% CI, 5.54-9.70; P\,=\,4.13\,{\texttimes}\,10-44) in an independent dataset. Adding PRS into hypertension-prediction models increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) from 0.791 (95\% CI, 0.781-0.801) to 0.826 (95\% CI, 0.817-0.836, ∆AUROC, 0.035, P\,=\,1.98\,{\texttimes}\,10-34). We compare the 2,103 loci results in non-European ancestries and show significant PRS associations in a large African-American sample. Secondary analyses implicate 500 genes previously unreported for BP. Our study highlights the role of increasingly large genomic studies for precision health research.},

Overall, the 8-year relative risk of HF is 24\% lower in women compared with men. The 8-year incidence rates of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF; EF {$>$}45\%) and HF with reduced EF (HFREF; EF {$\leq$} 45\%) in women and HFPEF in men are similar; however, men have a 2-fold higher cumulative incidence of HFREF than HFPEF. The lifetime risk of HF is about 20\% in both women and men at 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 years of age. Contribution of hypertension and diabetes mellitus to the risk of HF was more prominent in women than in men. Serum levels of several biomarkers were distinctly different in women compared with men and had differential effects on left ventricular structure and function; however, the strength and direction of the association between biomarkers levels and HF risk were generally similar in women and men. In individuals with HF, about two-thirds of the underlying cause of death and about one-half of the immediate cause of death were due to cardiovascular causes. Non-cardiovascular underlying and immediate causes of death were more evident in HFPEF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extreme obesity is recognized to be a risk factor for heart failure. It is unclear whether overweight and lesser degrees of obesity also pose a risk. METHODS: We investigated the relation between the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and the incidence of heart failure among 5881 participants in the Framingham Heart Study (mean age, 55 years; 54 percent women). With the use of Cox proportional-hazards models, the body-mass index was evaluated both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable (normal, 18.5 to 24.9; overweight, 25.0 to 29.9; and obese, 30.0 or more). RESULTS: During follow-up (mean, 14 years), heart failure developed in 496 subjects (258 women and 238 men). After adjustment for established risk factors, there was an increase in the risk of heart failure of 5 percent for men and 7 percent for women for each increment of 1 in body-mass index. As compared with subjects with a normal body-mass index, obese subjects had a doubling of the risk of heart failure. For women, the hazard ratio was 2.12 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.51 to 2.97); for men, the hazard ratio was 1.90 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.30 to 2.79). A graded increase in the risk of heart failure was observed across categories of body-mass index. The hazard ratios per increase in category were 1.46 in women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.72) and 1.37 in men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.67). CONCLUSIONS: In our large, community-based sample, increased body-mass index was associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Given the high prevalence of obesity in the United States, strategies to promote optimal body weight may reduce the population burden of heart failure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND - Statins reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients, but their potential benefit as treatment for heart failure (HF) is less clear. METHODS AND RESULTS - Patients (n=10 001) with stable coronary disease were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin 80 or 10 mg/d and followed up for a median of 4.9 years. A history of HF was present in 7.8\% of patients. A known ejection fraction {\textexclamdown}30\% and advanced HF were exclusion criteria for the study. A predefined secondary end point of the study was hospitalization for HF. The incidence of hospitalization for HF was 2.4\% in the 80-mg arm and 3.3\% in the 10-mg arm (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95\% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.94; P=0.0116). The treatment effect of the higher dose was more marked in patients with a history of HF: 17.3\% versus 10.6\% in the 10- and 80-mg arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95\% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.88; P=0.009). Among patients without a history of HF, the rates of hospitalization for HF were much lower: 1.8\% in the 80-mg group and 2.0\% in the 10-mg group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval, 0.64 to 1.16; P=0.34). Only one third of patients hospitalized for HF had evidence of preceding angina or myocardial infarction during the study period. Blood pressure was almost identical during follow-up in the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS - Compared with a lower dose, intensive treatment with atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease significantly reduces hospitalizations for HF. In a post hoc analysis, this benefit was observed only in patients with a history of HF. The mechanism accounting for this benefit is unlikely to be due primarily to a reduction in interim coronary events or differences in blood pressure. {\copyright} 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.},

  abstract = {Leveraging high-dimensional molecular datasets can help us develop mechanistic insight into associations between genetic variants and complex traits. In this study, we integrated human proteome data derived from brain tissue to evaluate whether targeted proteins putatively mediate the effects of genetic variants on seven neurological phenotypes (Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depression, insomnia, intelligence, neuroticism, and schizophrenia). Applying the principles of Mendelian randomization (MR) systematically across the genome highlighted 43 effects between genetically predicted proteins derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and these outcomes. Furthermore, genetic colocalization provided evidence that the same causal variant at 12 of these loci was responsible for variation in both protein and neurological phenotype. This included genes such as DCC, which encodes the netrin-1 receptor and has an important role in the development of the nervous system (p = 4.29~{\texttimes} 10-11 with neuroticism), as well as SARM1, which has been previously implicated in axonal degeneration (p = 1.76~{\texttimes} 10-08 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We additionally conducted a phenome-wide MR study for each of these 12 genes to assess potential pleiotropic effects on 700 complex traits and diseases. Our findings suggest that genes such as SNX32, which was initially associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease, may potentially influence other complex traits in the opposite direction. In contrast, genes such as CTSH (which was also associated with Alzheimer disease) and SARM1 may make worthwhile therapeutic targets because they did not have genetically predicted effects on any of the other phenotypes after correcting for multiple testing.},

Using the Finnish nationwide drug purchase registry with follow-up since 1995, we performed genome-wide association analyses of longitudinal patterns of medication use in hyperlipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes in up to 193,933 individuals (55\% women) in the FinnGen study. In meta-analyses of up to 567,671 individuals combining FinnGen with the Estonian Biobank and the UK Biobank, we discovered 333 independent loci (P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10--9) associated with medication use. Fine-mapping revealed 494 95\% credible sets associated with the total number of medication purchases, changes in medication combinations or treatment discontinuation, including 46 credible sets in 40 loci not associated with the underlying treatment targets. The polygenic risk scores (PRS) for cardiometabolic risk factors were strongly associated with the medication-use behavior. A medication-use enhanced multitrait PRS for coronary artery disease matched the performance of a risk factor-based multitrait coronary artery disease PRS in an independent sample (UK Biobank, n\,=\,343,676). In summary, we demonstrate medication-based strategies for identifying cardiometabolic risk loci and provide genome-wide tools for preventing cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotes must balance the metabolic and cell death actions of mitochondria via control of gene expression and cell fate by chromatin, thereby functionally binding the metabolome and epigenome. This interaction has far-reaching implications for chronic diseases in humans, the most common of which are those of the cardiovascular system. The most devastating consequence of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, is not a single disease, diagnosis, or endpoint. Human and animal studies have revealed that, regardless of etiology and symptoms, heart failure is universally associated with abnormal metabolism and gene expression - to frame this as cause or consequence, however, may be to wrongfoot the question. This essay aims to challenge current thinking on metabolic-epigenetic crosstalk in heart failure, presenting hypotheses for how chronic diseases arise, take hold, and persist. We unpack assumptions about the order of operations for gene expression and metabolism, exploring recent findings in noncardiac systems that link metabolic intermediates directly to chromatin remodeling. Lastly, we discuss potential mechanisms by which chromatin may serve as a substrate for metabolic memory, and how changes in cellular transcriptomes (and hence in cellular behavior) in response to stress correspond to global changes in chromatin accessibility and structure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with systolic heart failure have generally been excluded from statin trials. Acute coronary events are uncommon in this population, and statins have theoretical risks in these patients. METHODS: A total of 5011 patients at least 60 years of age with New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV ischemic, systolic heart failure were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of rosuvastatin or placebo per day. The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included death from any cause, any coronary event, death from cardiovascular causes, and the number of hospitalizations. RESULTS: As compared with the placebo group, patients in the rosuvastatin group had decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (difference between groups, 45.0\%; P{\textexclamdown}0.001) and of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (difference between groups, 37.1\%; P{\textexclamdown}0.001). During a median follow-up of 32.8 months, the primary outcome occurred in 692 patients in the rosuvastatin group and 732 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.02; P=0.12), and 728 patients and 759 patients, respectively, died (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.86 to 1.05; P=0.31). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the coronary outcome or death from cardiovascular causes. In a prespecified secondary analysis, there were fewer hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes in the rosuvastatin group (2193) than in the placebo group (2564) (P{\textexclamdown}0.001). No excessive episodes of muscle-related or other adverse events occurred in the rosuvastatin group. CONCLUSIONS: Rosuvastatin did not reduce the primary outcome or the number of deaths from any cause in older patients with systolic heart failure, although the drug did reduce the number of cardiovascular hospitalizations. The drug did not cause safety problems. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00206310.) Copyright ? 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society.},

In addition to providing causal insights into disease, these endeavours have yielded and enabled the refinement of polygenic risk scores. These scores can be used to predict incident coronary artery disease in multiple cohorts and indicate the clinical response to some preventive therapies in post hoc analyses of clinical trials. These observations and the widespread ability to calculate polygenic risk scores from direct-to-consumer and health-care-associated biobanks have raised many questions about responsible clinical adoption. In this Review, we describe technical and downstream considerations for the derivation and validation of polygenic risk scores and current evidence for their efficacy and safety. We discuss the implementation of these scores in clinical medicine for uses including risk prediction and screening algorithms for coronary artery disease, prioritization of patient subgroups that are likely to derive benefit from treatment, and efficient prospective clinical trial designs.},

We aimed to investigate whether temporal patterns of these biomarkers are related to clinical outcome in patients with stable chronic heart failure (CHF). Methods and Results: In 263 patients with CHF, we performed serial plasma measurements of scavenger receptor cysteine-rich type 1 protein M130 (CD163), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (TRAP), granulins (GRN), spondin-1 (SPON1), peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The Cardiovascular Panel III (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used. During 2.2 years of follow-up, we collected 1984 samples before the occurrence of the composite primary endpoint (PE) or censoring. For efficiency, we selected 567 samples for the measurements (all baseline samples, the last two samples preceding the PE, and the last sample before censoring in event-free patients). The relationship between repeatedly measured biomarker levels and the PE was evaluated by joint models. Mean ({\textpm}standard deviation) age was 67 {\textpm} 13 years; 189 (72\%) were men; left ventricular ejection fraction (\%) was 32 {\textpm} 11. During follow-up, 70 (27\%) patients experienced the PE. Serially measured biomarkers predicted the PE in a multivariable model adjusted for baseline clinical characteristics [hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval) per 1-standard deviation change in biomarker]: CD163 [2.07(1.47--2.98), P {\textexclamdown} 0.001], TRAP [0.62 (0.43--0.90), P = 0.009], GRN [2.46 (1.64--3.84), P {\textexclamdown} 0.001], SPON1 [3.94 (2.50--6.50), P {\textexclamdown} 0.001], and PGLYRP1 [1.62 (1.14--2.31), P = 0.006]. Conclusions: Changes in plasma levels of CD163, TRAP, GRN, SPON1, and PGLYRP1 precede adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHF.},

This risk may be modulated by improved cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as CRF is associated with favourable health outcomes. Thus, we assessed the interaction between body mass index (BMI), CRF and HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiorespiratory fitness and BMI were assessed in 20 254 US male veterans (mean age 58.0 {\textpm} 11.3 years), who completed a maximal exercise treadmill test between 1987 and 2017. All had no evidence of ischaemia or HF prior to the exercise test. They were classified based on age-stratified quartiles of peak metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved as: least-fit (4.5 {\textpm} 1.3), low-fit (6.7 {\textpm} 1.3), moderate-fit (8.1 {\textpm} 1.1), and high-fit (11.2 {\textpm} 2.4); and according to BMI as normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2 ), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2 ), and obese ({$\geq$} 30.0 kg/m2 ). During a median follow-up of 13.4 years, there were 2979 HF events (10.8 events/1000 person-years). HF risk was significantly higher in the obese category [hazard ratio (HR) 1.22, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.36; P {$<$} 0.001], but was no longer significant after further adjustment for METs. When compared to the least-fit, HF risk declined progressively with increased CRF within all BMI categories. The risk was 63\% (HR 0.37, 95\% CI 0.30-0.47; P {$<$} 0.001), 66\% (HR 0.37, 95\% CI 0.28-0.40; P {$<$} 0.001), and 73\% (HR 0.27, 95\% CI 0.22-0.34; P {$<$} 0.001) lower for high-fit individuals within normal weight, overweight and obese categories, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CRF was associated with progressively lower HF risk regardless of BMI, suggesting that the elevated HF risk associated with obesity may be modulated by improved CRF.},

  abstract = {AIMS: A network meta-analysis (NMA) of all recommended drug groups for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), including their combinations, was performed to assess the relative efficacy and incremental benefit. METHODS AND RESULTS: A search was made in biomedical databases for randomized controlled trials published between 1987 and 2017 on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), ivabradine (IVA), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI). A total of 58 relevant trials were identified. The relative efficacy of each treatment group (or combination) in terms of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause hospitalizations and hospitalizations for heart failure, per patient-year of follow-up, were combined in a random-effects Bayesian NMA. The pairwise comparison between each regimen and for each outcome was estimated. The NMA was dominated by 15 large-scale trials with between 1984 and 18\,898 patient-years of follow-up. Combinations of drug groups showed incremental benefits on outcomes over single groups. The most effective combinations were ARNI+BB\,+\,MRA and ACEI+BB\,+\,MRA\,+\,IVA, showing reductions in all-cause mortality (vs. placebo) of 62\% and 59\%, respectively; hazard ratios were 0.38 [credible interval (CrI) 0.20-0.65] and 0.41 (CrI 0.21-0.70); and in all-cause hospitalizations with reductions of 42\% for both. These two combinations were also the most effective for the other outcomes studied. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that the incremental use of combinations of disease-modifying therapies has resulted in the progressive improvement in mortality and hospitalization outcomes in HFrEF. Our findings support the current guideline recommendations.},

  abstract = {The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a key physiological regulator of insulin secretion and a major therapeutic target for the treatment of type II diabetes. However, regulation of GLP-1R function is complex with multiple endogenous peptides that interact with the receptor, including full-length (1--37) and truncated (7--37) forms of GLP-1 that can exist in an amidated form (GLP-1(1--36)NH2 and GLP-1(7--36)NH2) and the related peptide oxyntomodulin. In addition, the GLP-1R possesses exogenous agonists, including exendin-4, and the allosteric modulator, compound 2 (6,7-dichloro-2-methylsulfonyl-3-tert-butylaminoquinoxaline). The complexity of this ligand-receptor system is further increased by the presence of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are distributed across the receptor. We have investigated 10 GLP-1R SNPs, which were characterized in three physiologically relevant signaling pathways (cAMP accumulation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization); ligand binding and cell surface receptor expression were also determined. We demonstrate both ligand- and pathway-specific effects for multiple SNPs, with the most dramatic effect observed for the Met149 receptor variant. At the Met149 variant, there was selective loss of peptide-induced responses across all pathways examined, but preservation of response to the small molecule compound 2. In contrast, at the Cys333 variant, peptide responses were preserved but there was attenuated response to compound 2. Strikingly, the loss of peptide function at the Met149 receptor variant could be allosterically rescued by compound 2, providing proof-of-principle evidence that allosteric drugs could be used to treat patients with this loss of function variant.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: As myocardial fibrosis might be an important contributor to the association of obesity with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure, we investigated the effects of spironolactone on LV function and serological fibrosis markers (procollagen type III N-terminal propeptide (PIIINP) and procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide (PICP)) in patients with obesity and abnormal LV performance. DESIGN: A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: A university hospital. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: 113 patients (mean{\textpm}SD age 58{\textpm}8 years) with body mass index{$\geq$}30, without any comorbidities, with impaired early diastolic mitral annular velocity, randomised to spironolactone 25 mg/day or placebo for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Echocardiographically derived indices of LV systolic (strain and strain rate) and diastolic (E velocity, tissue e' and E/e' ratio) function, myocardial reflectivity (calibrated integrated backscatter (IB)), and serum PICP and PIIINP. RESULTS: In the spironolactone group, significant improvements in myocardial deformation, peak early diastolic velocity (Em), E/e' and IB were noted with a simultaneous decrease in PICP and PIIINP. No corresponding alterations were found with placebo. Improvement in LV systolic function (increase in strain) was independently associated with baseline strain ({$\beta$}=-0.43, p{$<$}0.001), change in IB ({$\beta$}=0.26, p{$<$}0.02) and baseline PICP ({$\beta$}=0.24, p{$<$}0.04). Among the independent determinants of LV diastolic improvement were for increase in Em - baseline Em ({$\beta$}=-0.44, p{$<$}0.001) and baseline PICP ({$\beta$}=0.35, p{$<$}0.002), and for decrease in E/e' - baseline E/e' ({$\beta$}=-0.35, p{$<$}0.005) and change in PICP ({$\beta$}=0.25, p{$<$}0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with obesity without other comorbidities, aldosterone antagonism improves LV function and myocardial acoustic properties, and reduces circulating procollagen levels. Beneficial changes in cardiac performance are independently predicted by baseline LV dysfunction and baseline disturbances, as well as treatment-induced improvements in fibrosis markers.

The arterial-pressure control mechanism of diuresis and natriuresis, according to the principle of infinite feedback gain, seems to be shifted toward higher blood-pressure levels in obese individuals. During the early phases of obesity, primary sodium retention exists as a result of increase in renal tubular reabsorption. Extracellular-fluid volume is expanded and the kidney-fluid apparatus is resetted to a hypertensive level, consistent with a model of hypertension because of volume overload. Plasma renin activity, angiotensinogen, angiotensin II and aldosterone values display significant increase during obesity. Insulin resistance and inflammation may promote an altered profile of vascular function and consequently hypertension. Leptin and other neuropeptides are possible links between obesity and the development of hypertension. Obesity should be considered as a chronic medical condition, which is likely to require long-term treatment. Understanding of the mechanisms associated with obesity-related hypertension is essential for successful treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors of left ventricular mass corrected for height2.7 (LVMI) and left ventricular hypertrophy in patients who were found to be normotensive with both office and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements. METHODS: A total of 805 consecutive patients were analyzed. All patients underwent office BP measurements, 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, laboratory measurements for cardiovascular risk factors and echocardiography. Individuals with both office and ambulatory normotension were characterized as true normotensive. RESULTS: LVMI was found to be 34.5 +/- 10.9 g/m2.7 in normal-weight patients and 48.7 +/- 13.0 g/m2.7 in obese patients (P {$<$} 0.0001). LVMI was found to be 41.7 +/- 10 g/m2.7 in overweight patients, significantly lower than the values of obese patients (P {$<$} 0.005) and higher than the values of normal-weight patients (P {$<$} 0.001). These results remained significant even after adjustment for age, sex, daytime and nighttime SBP, daytime and nighttime DBP, daytime and nighttime BP variability and daytime and nighttime pulse pressure (PP). In a multivariate analysis model, in which LVMI was the dependent variable and office SBP, office DBP, daytime and nighttime SBP and DBP, daytime and nighttime PPs and variabilities, day-night SBP ratio, fasting serum glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, age and BMI were inserted as independent variables with weighted least squares regression by sex, the predictors of LVMI were age, BMI and daytime PP (r2 = 0.31). Left ventricular hypertrophy was 17.67 times more likely in obese patients as compared with normal-weight true normotensive individuals. CONCLUSION: Obesity may represent a significant cardiovascular risk factor even in normotensive individuals. Other predictors of LVMI were ageing and daytime PP.},

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for eligible placebo-controlled trials reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; ie, cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction) up to June 15, 2019.

  abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 94 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer (BC) risk and 18 associated with ovarian cancer (OC) risk. Several of these are also associated with risk of BC or OC for women who carry a pathogenic mutation in the high-risk BC and OC genes BRCA1 or BRCA2. The combined effects of these variants on BC or OC risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have not yet been assessed while their clinical management could benefit from improved personalized risk estimates.,  Methods: We constructed polygenic risk scores (PRS) using BC and OC susceptibility SNPs identified through population-based GWAS: for BC (overall, estrogen receptor [ER]--positive, and ER-negative) and for OC. Using data from 15 252 female BRCA1 and 8211 BRCA2 carriers, the association of each PRS with BC or OC risk was evaluated using a weighted cohort approach, with time to diagnosis as the outcome and estimation of the hazard ratios (HRs) per standard deviation increase in the PRS.,  Results: The PRS for ER-negative BC displayed the strongest association with BC risk in BRCA1 carriers (HR\,=\,1.27, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23 to 1.31, P\,=\,8.2{\texttimes}10-53). In BRCA2 carriers, the strongest association with BC risk was seen for the overall BC PRS (HR\,=\,1.22, 95\% CI\,=\,1.17 to 1.28, P\,=\,7.2{\texttimes}10-20). The OC PRS was strongly associated with OC risk for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. These translate to differences in absolute risks (more than 10\% in each case) between the top and bottom deciles of the PRS distribution; for example, the OC risk was 6\% by age 80 years for BRCA2 carriers at the 10th percentile of the OC PRS compared with 19\% risk for those at the 90th percentile of PRS.,  Conclusions: BC and OC PRS are predictive of cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Incorporation of the PRS into risk prediction models has promise to better inform decisions on cancer risk management.},

  abstract = {Conventional measurements of fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels investigated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) cannot capture the effects of DNA variability on `around the clock' glucoregulatory processes. Here we show that GWAS meta-analysis of glucose measurements under nonstandardized conditions (random glucose (RG)) in 476,326 individuals of diverse ancestries and without diabetes enables locus discovery and innovative pathophysiological observations. We discovered 120 RG loci represented by 150 distinct signals, including 13 with sex-dimorphic effects, two cross-ancestry and seven rare frequency signals. Of these, 44 loci are new for glycemic traits. Regulatory, glycosylation and metagenomic annotations highlight ileum and colon tissues, indicating an underappreciated role of the gastrointestinal tract in controlling blood glucose. Functional follow-up and molecular dynamics simulations of lower frequency coding variants in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R), a type 2 diabetes treatment target, reveal that optimal selection of GLP-1R agonist therapy will benefit from tailored genetic stratification. We also provide evidence from Mendelian randomization that lung function is modulated by blood glucose and that pulmonary dysfunction is a diabetes complication. Our investigation yields new insights into the biology of glucose regulation, diabetes complications and pathways for treatment stratification.},

We sought to identify genetic risk factors associated with CHD and to accomplish a functional analysis of SNP-carrying genes. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 4034 White patients with CHD and 8486 healthy controls. One SNP on chromosome 5q22.2 reached genome-wide significance across all CHD phenotypes and was also indicative for septal defects. One region on chromosome 20p12.1 pointing to the MACROD2 locus identified 4 highly significant SNPs in patients with transposition of the great arteries (TGA). Three highly significant risk variants on chromosome 17q21.32 within the GOSR2 locus were detected in patients with anomalies of thoracic arteries and veins (ATAV). Genetic variants associated with ATAV are suggested to influence the expression of WNT3, and the variant rs870142 related to septal defects is proposed to influence the expression of MSX1. We analyzed the expression of all 4 genes during cardiac differentiation of human and murine induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro and by single-cell RNA-Seq analyses of developing murine and human hearts. Our data show that MACROD2, GOSR2, WNT3, and MSX1 play an essential functional role in heart development at the embryonic and newborn stages.},

  abstract = {Background Obesity is associated with increased mortality in the general population but, paradoxically, with decreased mortality in individuals with diabetes. Methods Among 88,373 French women participating in the E3N-EPIC study who were free of diabetes in 1990, we estimated the mortality hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for body-mass index (BMI) levels by diabetes status. Results During an average 16.7 years of follow-up, 3,750 deaths and 2,421 incident diabetes cases occurred. In overweight/obese versus normal weight women, the mortality HR (95\%CI) was 1.42 (1.32,1.53) in women without diabetes, and 0.69 (0.40,1.18) in women with incident diabetes. Mortality increased with BMI among women without diabetes and decreased as BMI increased in women with diabetes. Conclusions We found a direct association between BMI and mortality among women without diabetes but not among those with incident diabetes in the same population. Selection bias may be a simple explanation for this ``paradox''.},

Our primary aim was to apply the Mendelian randomization design to investigate the associations of body mass index (BMI) with 13 CVDs and arterial hypertension. We also assessed the roles of fat mass and fat-free mass on the same outcomes. Methods and results Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI and fat mass and fat-free mass indices were used as instrumental variables to estimate the associations with the cardiovascular conditions among 367 703 UK Biobank participants. After correcting for multiple testing, genetically predicted BMI was significantly positively associated with eight outcomes, including and with decreasing magnitude of association: aortic valve stenosis, heart failure, deep vein thrombosis, arterial hypertension, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary embolism. The odds ratio (OR) per 1\,kg/m2 increase in BMI ranged from 1.06 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.02--1.11; P\,=\,2.6\,{\texttimes}\,10-3] for pulmonary embolism to 1.13 (95\% CI 1.05--1.21; P\,=\,1.2\,{\texttimes}\,10-3) for aortic valve stenosis. There was suggestive evidence of positive associations of genetically predicted fat mass index with nine outcomes (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). The strongest magnitude of association was with aortic valve stenosis (OR per 1\,kg/m2 increase in fat mass index 1.46, 95\% CI 1.13--1.88; P\,=\,3.9\,{\texttimes}\,10-3). There was suggestive evidence of inverse associations of fat-free mass index with atrial fibrillation, ischaemic stroke, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Conclusion This study provides evidence that higher BMI and particularly fat mass index are associated with increased risk of aortic valve stenosis and most other cardiovascular conditions.,},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness (FIT) on survival in relation to the obesity paradox in patients with systolic heart failure (HF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 2066 patients with systolic HF (body mass index [BMI] {$\geq$}18.5 kg/m(2)) between April 1, 1993 and May 11, 2011 (with 1784 [86\%] tested after January 31, 2000) from a multicenter cardiopulmonary exercise testing database who were followed for up to 5 years (mean {\textpm} SD, 25.0{\textpm}17.5 months) to determine the impact of FIT (peak oxygen consumption {$<$}14 vs {$\geq$}14 mL O2 {$\bullet$} kg(-1) {$\bullet$} min(-1)) on the obesity paradox. RESULTS: There were 212 deaths during follow-up (annual mortality, 4.5\%). In patients with low FIT, annual mortality was 8.2\% compared with 2.8\% in those with high FIT (P{$<$}.001). After adjusting for age and sex, BMI was a significant predictor of survival in the low FIT subgroup when expressed as a continuous (P=.03) and dichotomous ({$<$}25.0 vs {$\geq$}25.0 kg/m(2)) (P=.01) variable. Continuous and dichotomous BMI expressions were not significant predictors of survival in the overall and high FIT groups after adjusting for age and sex. In patients with low FIT, progressively worse survival was noted with BMI of 30.0 or greater, 25.0 to 29.9, and 18.5 to 24.9 (log-rank, 11.7; P=.003), whereas there was no obesity paradox noted in those with high FIT (log-rank, 1.72; P=.42). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that FIT modifies the relationship between BMI and survival. Thus, assessing the obesity paradox in systolic HF may be misleading unless FIT is considered.},

Only limited data are available on the prognostic ability of maximal oxygen (O(2)) pulse, an indicator of stroke volume and arteriovenous O(2) difference, especially when corrected for lean body mass. Cardiopulmonary exercise tests were performed in 209 consecutive patients with mild-to-moderate HF (mean ejection fraction 23\%), followed for 19 +/- 12 months to determine the impact of maximal O(2) pulse in relation to other cardiopulmonary variables on major clinical events (13 cardiovascular deaths and 15 urgent transplantations). Compared with patients with clinical events, those without major events had a higher peak O(2) pulse (11.4 +/- 4.1 vs 9.2 +/- 2.3 ml/beat, p {$<$}0.0001) and body fat-adjusted peak O(2) pulse (15.6 +/- 5.6 vs 11.9 +/- 3.4 ml/beat, p {$<$}0.0001). In multivariate analysis, a low peak O(2) pulse was the strongest independent predictor of clinical events (chi-square 10.5, p {$<$}0.01). Although peak O(2) pulse was a stronger predictor for clinical events than any other exercise cardiopulmonary variable, including peak VO(2), peak VO(2) lean (defined as the VO(2) corrected for lean body mass), and percentage of predicted peak VO(2), this relation was further strengthened by correcting peak O(2) pulse for percent body fat (chi-square 12.4, p {$<$}0.001). In most subgroups (including women, obese subjects, those receiving beta blockers, and those with class III HF), peak O(2) pulse lean was similar to or superior to peak VO(2) lean for predicting major clinical events. Especially in patients who were class III HF and who were receiving beta blockers, peak VO(2) (cutoff 14 ml/kg/min) poorly predicted prognosis; risk stratification was best with peak O(2) pulse lean (cutoff 14 ml/beat). These data indicate the potential usefulness of peak O(2) pulse and lean body mass-adjusted O(2) pulse for predicting prognosis in patients with systolic HF.},

METHODS: We examined the cross-sectional association of heart failure in parents with the prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as well as left ventricular mass, internal dimensions, and wall thickness, in 1497 participants of the Framingham Offspring Study (mean age, 57 years; 819 women) who underwent routine echocardiography. We also investigated prospectively whether heart failure in parents increased the risk of heart failure in 2214 offspring (mean age, 44 years; 1150 women). RESULTS: As compared with the 1039 participants whose parents did not have heart failure, the 458 participants in the cross-sectional cohort who had at least one parent with heart failure were more likely to have increased left ventricular mass (17.0 percent vs. 26.9 percent), left ventricular internal dimensions (18.6 percent vs. 23.4 percent), and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (3.1 percent vs. 5.7 percent); the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios were 1.35 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.84), 1.29 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.72), and 2.37 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 4.61), respectively. In the longitudinal cohort, heart failure developed in 90 offspring during follow-up (mean length of follow-up, 20 years). The age- and sex-adjusted 10-year incidence rates of heart failure were 2.72 percent among offspring with a parent with heart failure, as compared with 1.62 percent among those without a parent with heart failure. This increase in risk persisted after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.60). CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure in parents is associated with an increased prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction cross-sectionally and an elevated risk of heart failure longitudinally. Our data emphasize the contribution of familial factors to the heart-failure burden in the community.},

  abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a complex trait, influenced by environmental and genetic factors, that affects over 30 million individuals worldwide. Historically, the genetics of HF have been studied in Mendelian forms of disease, where rare genetic variants have been linked to familial cardiomyopathies. More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with risk of HF. However, the relative importance of genetic variants across the allele-frequency spectrum remains incompletely characterized. Here, we report the results of common- and rare-variant association studies of all-cause heart failure, applying recently developed methods to quantify the heritability of HF attributable to different classes of genetic variation. We combine GWAS data across multiple populations including 207,346 individuals with HF and 2,151,210 without, identifying 176 risk loci at genome-wide significance (p {$<$} 5{\texttimes}10-8). Signals at newly identified common-variant loci include coding variants in Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (MYBPC3, BAG3), as well as regulators of lipoprotein (LPL) and glucose metabolism (GIPR, GLP1R), and are enriched in cardiac, muscle, nerve, and vascular tissues, as well as myocyte and adipocyte cell types. Gene burden studies across three biobanks (PMBB, UKB, AOU) including 27,208 individuals with HF and 349,126 without uncover exome-wide significant (p {$<$} 3.15{\texttimes}10-6) associations for HF and rare predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in TTN, MYBPC3, FLNC, and BAG3. Total burden heritability of rare coding variants (2.2\%, 95\% CI 0.99-3.5\%) is highly concentrated in a small set of Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes, and is lower than heritability attributable to common variants (4.3\%, 95\% CI 3.9-4.7\%) which is more diffusely spread throughout the genome. Finally, we demonstrate that common-variant background, in the form of a polygenic risk score (PRS), significantly modifies the risk of HF among carriers of pathogenic truncating variants in the Mendelian cardiomyopathy gene TTN. These findings suggest a significant polygenic component to HF exists that is not captured by current clinical genetic testing.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Controversy exists whether excess body fatness (measured by body mass index (BMI)) is associated with better cancer survival ("obesity paradox"). Here, we review the obesity paradox in cancer research and discuss potential explanations and future research directions. RECENT FINDINGS: Overweight and obese cancer patients have better survival for diverse cancers. This apparent obesity paradox may be largely explained by methodological limitations including reverse causation, selection bias, confounding, and reliance of BMI as a measure of adiposity in cancer patients. A growing number of studies show promising evidence that precisely quantified body composition can provide important prognostic information in cancer care, such that low muscle and high adiposity are associated with worse clinical outcomes in cancer patients. The term obesity paradox in cancer, implying a causally beneficial role of adiposity, is misleading. Understanding the role of muscle and adiposity may reduce the confusion and inform precision oncology care.},

  abstract = {Obesity condition causes morphological and functional alterations involving the cardiovascular system. These can represent the substrates for different cardiovascular diseases, such as atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, sudden cardiac death, and heart failure (HF) with both preserved ejection fraction (EF) and reduced EF. Different pathogenetic mechanisms may help to explain the association between obesity and HF including left ventricular remodelling and epicardial fat accumulation, endothelial dysfunction, and coronary microvascular dysfunction. Multi-imaging modalities are required for appropriate recognition of subclinical systolic dysfunction typically associated with obesity, with echocardiography being the most cost-effective technique. Therapeutic approach in patients with obesity and HF is challenging, particularly regarding patients with preserved EF in which few strategies with high level of evidence are available. Weight loss is of extreme importance in patients with obesity and HF, being a primary therapeutic intervention. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors have been recently introduced as a novel tool in the management of HF patients. The present review aims at analysing the most recent studies supporting pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management in patients with obesity and HF.},

  abstract = {There is a common perception that excess adiposity, commonly approximated by body mass index (BMI), is associated with reduced cancer survival. A number of studies have emerged challenging this by demonstrating that overweight and early obese states are associated with improved survival. This finding is termed the ``obesity paradox'' and is well recognized in the cardio-metabolic literature but less so in oncology. Here, we summarize the epidemiological findings related to the obesity paradox in cancer. Our review highlights that many observations of the obesity paradox in cancer reflect methodological mechanisms including the crudeness of BMI as an obesity measure, confounding, detection bias, reverse causality, and a specific form of the selection bias, known as collider bias. It is imperative for the oncologist to interpret the observation of the obesity paradox against the above methodological framework and avoid the misinterpretation that being obese might be ``good'' or ``protective'' for cancer patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite improving evidence-based practice following clinical guidelines to optimise drug therapy, Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) still exerts a devastating toll from vascular complications and premature death. Biochemical remission of T2DM has been demonstrated with weight loss around 15kg following bariatric surgery and in several small studies of non-surgical energy-restriction treatments. The non-surgical Counterweight-Plus programme, running in Primary Care where obesity and T2DM are routinely managed, produces {$>$}15 kg weight loss in 33\% of all enrolled patients. The Diabetes UK-funded Counterpoint study suggested that this should be sufficient to reverse T2DM by removing ectopic fat in liver and pancreas, restoring first-phase insulin secretion. The Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) was designed to determine whether a structured, intensive, weight management programme, delivered in a routine Primary Care setting, is a viable treatment for achieving durable normoglycaemia. Other aims are to understand the mechanistic basis of remission and to identify psychological predictors of response. METHODS/DESIGN: Cluster-randomised design with GP practice as the unit of randomisation: 280 participants from around 30 practices in Scotland and England will be allocated either to continue usual guideline-based care or to add the Counterweight-Plus weight management programme, which includes primary care nurse or dietitian delivery of 12-20weeks low calorie diet replacement, food reintroduction, and long-term weight loss maintenance. Main inclusion criteria: men and women aged 20-65 years, all ethnicities, T2DM 0-6years duration, BMI 27-45 kg/m(2). Tyneside participants will undergo Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies of pancreatic and hepatic fat, and metabolic studies to determine mechanisms underlying T2DM remission. Co-primary endpoints: weight reduction\,{$\geq$}\,15 kg and HbA1c {$<$}48 mmol/mol at one year. Further follow-up at 2 years. DISCUSSION: This study will establish whether a structured weight management programme, delivered in Primary Care by practice nurses or dietitians, is a viable treatment to achieve T2DM remission. Results, available from 2018 onwards, will inform future service strategy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN03267836 . Date of Registration 20/12/2013.},

  abstract = {Heart failure is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the contribution of common genetic variation to heart failure risk has not been fully elucidated, particularly in comparison to other common cardiometabolic traits. We report a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study meta-analysis of all-cause heart failure including up to 115,150 cases and 1,550,331 controls of diverse genetic ancestry, identifying 47 risk loci. We also perform multivariate genome-wide association studies that integrate heart failure with related cardiac magnetic resonance imaging endophenotypes, identifying 61 risk loci. Gene-prioritization analyses including colocalization and transcriptome-wide association studies identify known and previously unreported candidate cardiomyopathy genes and cellular processes, which we validate in gene-expression profiling of failing and healthy human hearts. Colocalization, gene expression profiling, and Mendelian randomization provide convergent evidence for the roles of BCKDHA and circulating branch-chain amino acids in heart failure and cardiac structure. Finally, proteome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies 9 circulating proteins associated with heart failure or quantitative imaging traits. These analyses highlight similarities and differences among heart failure and associated cardiovascular imaging endophenotypes, implicate common genetic variation in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and identify circulating proteins that may represent cardiomyopathy treatment targets.},

  abstract = {Body mass index (BMI) is a complex disease risk factor known to be influenced by genes acting via both metabolic pathways and appetite regulation. In this study, we aimed to gain insight into the phenotypic consequences of BMI-associated genetic variants, which may be mediated by their expression in different tissues. First, we harnessed meta-analyzed gene expression datasets derived from subcutaneous adipose (n = 1257) and brain (n = 1194) tissue to identify 86 and 140 loci, respectively, which provided evidence of genetic colocalization with BMI. These two sets of tissue-partitioned loci had differential effects with respect to waist-to-hip ratio, suggesting that the way they influence fat distribution might vary despite their having very similar average magnitudes of effect on BMI itself (adipose = 0.0148 and brain = 0.0149 standard deviation change in BMI per effect allele). For instance, BMI-associated variants colocalized with TBX15 expression in adipose tissue (posterior probability [PPA] = 0.97), but not when we used TBX15 expression data derived from brain tissue (PPA = 0.04) This gene putatively influences BMI via its role in skeletal development. Conversely, there were loci where BMI-associated variants provided evidence of colocalization with gene expression in brain tissue (e.g., NEGR1, PPA = 0.93), but not when we used data derived from adipose tissue, suggesting that these genes might be more likely to influence BMI via energy balance. Leveraging these tissue-partitioned variant sets through a multivariable Mendelian randomization framework provided strong evidence that the brain-tissue-derived variants are predominantly responsible for driving the genetically predicted effects of BMI on cardiovascular-disease endpoints (e.g., coronary artery disease: odds ratio = 1.05, 95\% confidence interval = 1.04-1.07, p~= 4.67~{\texttimes} 10-14). In contrast, our analyses suggested that the adipose tissue variants might predominantly be responsible for the underlying relationship between BMI and measures of cardiac function, such as left ventricular stroke volume (beta = 0.21, 95\% confidence interval = 0.09-0.32, p = 6.43~{\texttimes} 10-4).},

  abstract = {Background This study compared the strength and causality of associations between major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the four major CVDs: myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Both a long-term follow-up in an observational cohort and Mendelian randomisation (MR) were used for this aim.Methods In the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men study, 2322 men, all aged 50 years, were assessed for CVD risk factors and then followed for four decades regarding incident CVDs. The two-sample MR part used public available Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data.Results In multivariate analyses, systolic blood pressure was overall by far the most important risk factor, since it was related to all four CVDs, both in observational and MR analyses. Body mass index was the second most overall important risk factor, being linked to all four CVDs, except ischaemic stroke, both in observational and MR analyses. Smoking was an important risk factor for ischaemic stroke and heart failure, both in observational and MR analyses, while low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol mainly was related to myocardial infarction. Diabetes was mainly a causal risk factor for incident myocardial infarction and heart failure. Neither HDL-cholesterol nor triglycerides were of major importance as risk factors in these multivariable models.Conclusion By combining long-term observational data with genetic data, we show that the impact and causal role of specific established cardiovascular risk factors varies between different major CVDs. Systolic blood pressure was causally related to all four cardiovascular outcomes and was therefore, overall, the most important risk factor.},

The relationship between genetic polymorphisms of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP1R) gene and unresponsiveness to GLP-1 analogue treatment in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is unclear. Methods. Thirty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2 DM were enrolled and they received six days of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for this study. After the normalization of blood glucose in the first 3 days, the patients then received a combination therapy with injections of the GLP-1 analogue, exenatide, for another 3 days. All 13 exons and intron-exon boundaries of the GLP1R gene were amplified to investigate the association. Results. The short tandem repeat at 8GA/7GA (rs5875654) had complete linkage disequilibrium (LD, with ) with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs761386. Quantitative trait loci analysis of GLP1R gene variation with clinical response of GLP1 analogue showed the missense rs3765467 and rs761386 significantly associated with changes in the standard deviation of plasma glucose () ( and 0.019, resp.). The reported values became insignificant after multiple testing adjustments. Conclusion. The variable response to the GLP-1 analogue was not statistically correlated with polymorphisms of the GLP1R gene in patients with poorly controlled type 2 DM.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Most previous studies have examined associations between metabolic disorders measured at a single point in time and risk of heart failure (HF). However, there are many situations where the values of exposures vary over time before HF occurs. We aimed to examine the associations of time-varying obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) measured at multiple points in time with HF. METHODS: A total of 6750 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis from 2000 were included in the study. Follow-up was completed through December 2015. MetSyn was defined using the American Heart Association criteria. Incident HF was diagnosed by clinical criteria. Subtypes HF (reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved (HFpEF) were classified by left ventricular EF. RESULTS: A total of 331 HF cases were identified during 82,609 person-years of observation. The incidence (95\%CI) of total HF was 4.0 (3.4-4.4) per 1000 person-years. Of the total HF cases, 45.6\% were HFrEF (n = 151), 40.8\% HFpEF (n = 135), and 13.6\% were unclassified HF subtypes (n = 45). After adjusting for key covariates, time-varying obesity (BMI {$\geq$} 30 kg/m2) and MetSyn were significantly associated with HF, with a stronger association for HFpEF than for HFrEF. The corresponding hazards ratios (HR, 95\%CI) were 1.97 (1.43-2.72) and 1.86 (1.43-2.42) for HFpEF, and 1.46 (1.07-1.98), and 1.39 (1.06-1.82) for HFrEF respectively. Time-varying large waist circumference was significantly associated with for HFpEF, but not with HFrEF. CONCLUSION: Time-varying obesity and MetSyn were significantly associated with HF risk, with a stronger association with HFpEF than with HFrEF. Continued effort to control these risk factors is recommended.},

  abstract = {Tobacco and alcohol use are leading causes of mortality that influence risk for many complex diseases and disorders. They are heritable, and etiologically related, behaviors that have been resistant to gene discovery efforts--. In sample sizes up to 1.2 million individuals, we discovered 566 genetic variants in 406 loci associated with multiple stages of tobacco use (initiation, cessation, and heaviness) as well as alcohol use, with 150 loci evidencing pleiotropic association. Smoking phenotypes were positively genetically correlated with many health conditions, whereas alcohol use was negatively correlated with these conditions, such that increased genetic risk for alcohol use is associated with lower disease risk. We report evidence for the involvement of many systems in tobacco and alcohol use, including genes involved in nicotinic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission. The results provide a solid starting point to evaluate the effects of these loci in model organisms and more precise substance use measures.},

HN1L silencing reduced the population of BCSCs, inhibited tumor initiation, resensitized chemoresistant tumors to docetaxel, and hindered cancer progression in multiple TNBC cell line-derived xenografts. Additionally, gene signatures associated with HN1L correlated with shorter disease-free survival of TNBC patients. We defined HN1L as a BCSC transcription regulator for genes involved in the LEPR-STAT3 signaling axis as HN1L binds to a putative consensus upstream sequence of STAT3, LEPTIN RECEPTOR, and MIR-150.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac steatosis is common in patients with diabetes or obesity, and cardiac steatosis may result in cardiomyopathy. However, factors associated with cardiac steatosis have not been reported in healthy individuals without diabetes and hypertension. The objectives of this study were to explore factors associated with myocardial triglyceride levels, and to examine the association between myocardial triglyceride and regional left ventricular (LV) function in healthy African Americans (AAs). METHODS: Between November 2010 and June 2012, 92 healthy AAs aged 21 years or older, without clinical evidence of cardiac dysfunction, coronary artery disease, diabetes, or hypertension from Baltimore, Maryland, were enrolled in an observational proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging study investigating factors associated with cardiac steatosis, and the relationships between cardiac steatosis and LV volumes and LV function. RESULTS: Among the participants, all had a low Framingham risk; 31 had a normal BMI, 23 were overweight and 38 were obese. The median myocardial triglyceride content was 0.5\% (IQR: 0.3-1.0\%). Among the factors investigated, BMI (R2=0.43, p={$<$}0.0001) was independently associated with myocardial triglyceride. Overall, myocardial triglyceride was not associated with LV EF/structure, but may be associated with regional LV function. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy AA adults, obesity is associated with cardiac steatosis. In contrast to studies in patients with diabetes suggesting a link between cardiac steatosis and LV dysfunction, this study found no relationship between cardiac steatosis and left ventricular volumes or EF, though there is some evidence suggesting that cardiac steatosis may be associated with LV regional function in healthy AA women.},

  abstract = {Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {$<$} 5 {\texttimes} 10-8), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for {\textasciitilde}2.7\% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {$>$}20\% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

  abstract = {The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a class B G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and diabetes drug target expressed mainly in pancreatic {$\beta$}-cells that, when activated by its agonist glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) after a meal, stimulates insulin secretion and {$\beta$}-cell survival and proliferation. The N-terminal region of GLP-1 interacts with membrane-proximal residues of GLP-1R, stabilizing its active conformation to trigger intracellular signaling. The best-studied agonist peptides, GLP-1 and exendin-4, share sequence homology at their N-terminal region; however, modifications that can be tolerated here are not fully understood. In this work, a functional screen of GLP-1 variants with randomized N-terminal domains reveals new GLP-1R agonists and uncovers a pattern whereby a negative charge is preferred at the third position in various sequence contexts. We further tested this sequence--structure--activity principle by synthesizing peptide analogues where this position was mutated to both canonical and noncanonical amino acids. We discovered a highly active GLP-1 analogue in which the native glutamate residue three positions from the N-terminus was replaced with the sulfo-containing amino acid cysteic acid (GLP-1-CYA). The receptor binding and downstream signaling properties elicited by GLP-1-CYA were similar to the wild type GLP-1 peptide. Computational modeling identified a likely mode of interaction of the negatively charged side chain in GLP-1-CYA with an arginine on GLP-1R. This work highlights a strategy of combinatorial peptide screening coupled with chemical exploration that could be used to generate novel agonists for other receptors with peptide ligands.},

  abstract = {Obesity prevalence continues to rise worldwide, posing a substantial burden on people's health and wellbeing. However, up to 45\% of obese individuals do not suffer from cardiometabolic complications, also referred to as the metabolically healthy obese (MHO). Concurrently, up to 30\% of normal weight individuals demonstrate cardiometabolic risk factors that are typically only seen in obese individuals; the so called metabolically obese normal weight (MONW). Besides lifestyle factors (physical activity, diet, smoking, {\dots}) and demographic (age, sex, ancestry) factors, innate biological mechanisms are known to contribute to the etiology of the MHO and MONW phenotypes, as well. Experimental studies in animal models have shown that adipose tissue and adipocyte biology are key players, and mechanisms such as adipose tissue expandability, fat distribution, adipogenesis, vascularization of adipose tissue, inflammation, and mitochondrial function are the main mechanisms that uncouple adiposity from its cardiometabolic comorbidities. We reviewed the current studies that take advantage of genetic association data to expand insights into the biology of MHO/MONW phenotypes. At least four genetic loci were identified through genome-wide association studies for body fat percentage (BF\%) of which the BF\%-increasing allele was associated with a protective effect on glycemic and lipid outcomes. For some -- but not all -- this association was mediated through favorable effect on body fat distribution. Other studies that aimed to characterize the genetic susceptibility of insulin resistance, found that a higher genetic susceptibility was associated with lower overall adiposity due to less fat accumulation at hips and legs, suggesting that an impaired capacity to store fat in adipose tissue may be metabolically harmful. While these genetic association studies have started to provide new insights into the biology of MHO/MONW phenotypes, purposefully designed genome-wide association studies to discover new genes in a hypothesis-free manner have not yet been performed. Clearly, a lot more work remains to be done in this field, first through gene discovery, and subsequently through functional follow-up of identified genes.},

Polygenic (or common) obesity and rare, severe, early-onset monogenic obesity are often polarized as distinct diseases. However, gene discovery studies for both forms of obesity show that they have shared genetic and biological underpinnings, pointing to a key role for the brain in the control of body weight. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with increasing sample sizes and advances in sequencing technology are the main drivers behind a recent flurry of new discoveries. However, it is the post-GWAS, cross-disciplinary collaborations, which combine new omics technologies and analytical approaches, that have started to facilitate translation of genetic loci into meaningful biology and new avenues for treatment.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of common HF risk factors as potential mediators. Methods and Results Electronic health record data from primary care, hospital admissions and death registrations in England were used to perform an observational analysis. Data for 1.5 million individuals aged {$\geq$}18 years, with BMI measurements and free from heart failure at baseline, were included between 1998 and 2016. Cox models were used to estimate the association between BMI and HF with and without adjustment for atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD), and hypertension (HTN). Univariable and multivariable two-sample Mendelian randomisation was performed to estimate causal effects.Among non-underweight individuals, BMI was positively associated with HF with a 1-SD ({$\sim$} 4.8kg/m2) higher BMI associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.31 (1.30, 1.32). Genetically predicted BMI yielded a causal odds ratio (OR) of 1.64 per 4.8 kg/m2 BMI (1.58, 1.70) which attenuated by 41\% (to OR of 1.38 (95\% CI 1.31-1.45), when simultaneously accounting for AF, DM, CHD and SBP. Conclusion About 40\% of the excess risk of HF due to adiposity is driven by SBP, AF, DM and CHD. These findings highlight the importance of the prevention and treatment of excess adiposity and downstream HF risk factors to prevent HF, even in people in whom the above risk factors are well managed. One-sentence summary This study of the role of excess adiposity as a risk factor for HF, including an observational analysis of measured BMI 1.5 million individuals and multivariable MR analysis of genetically elevated BMI, provides evidence that adiposity is causally associated with HF, with approximately 40\% of the effect being mediated by conventional risk pathways.},

  abstract = {Aims The HERMES (HEart failure Molecular Epidemiology for Therapeutic targetS) consortium aims to identify the genomic and molecular basis of heart failure. Methods and results The consortium currently includes 51 studies from 11 countries, including 68 157 heart failure cases and 949 888 controls, with data on heart failure events and prognosis. All studies collected biological samples and performed genome-wide genotyping of common genetic variants. The enrolment of subjects into participating studies ranged from 1948 to the present day, and the median follow-up following heart failure diagnosis ranged from 2 to 116 months. Forty-nine of 51 individual studies enrolled participants of both sexes; in these studies, participants with heart failure were predominantly male (34--90\%). The mean age at diagnosis or ascertainment across all studies ranged from 54 to 84 years. Based on the aggregate sample, we estimated 80\% power to genetic variant associations with risk of heart failure with an odds ratio of {$\geq$}1.10 for common variants (allele frequency {$\geq$} 0.05) and {$\geq$}1.20 for low-frequency variants (allele frequency 0.01--0.05) at P {$<$} 5 {\texttimes} 10-8 under an additive genetic model. Conclusions HERMES is a global collaboration aiming to (i) identify the genetic determinants of heart failure; (ii) generate insights into the causal pathways leading to heart failure and enable genetic approaches to target prioritization; and (iii) develop genomic tools for disease stratification and risk prediction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Emerging evidence has raised an obesity paradox in observational studies of body mass index (BMI) and health among the oldest-old (aged {$\geq$}80 years), as an inverse relationship of BMI with mortality was reported. This study was to investigate the causal associations of BMI, waist circumference (WC), or both with mortality in the oldest-old people in China. METHODS: A total of 5306 community-based oldest-old (mean age 90.6 years) were enrolled in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) between 1998 and 2018. Genetic risk scores were constructed from 58 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI and 49 SNPs associated with WC to subsequently derive causal estimates for Mendelian randomization (MR) models. One-sample linear MR along with non-linear MR analyses were performed to explore the associations of genetically predicted BMI, WC, and their joint effect with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and non-CVD mortality. RESULTS: During 24 337 person-years of follow-up, 3766 deaths were documented. In observational analyses, higher BMI and WC were both associated with decreased mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR) 0.963, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.955-0.971 for a 1-kg/m2 increment of BMI and HR 0.971 (95\% CI 0.950-0.993) for each 5\>cm increase of WC]. Linear MR models indicated that each 1 kg/m2 increase in genetically predicted BMI was monotonically associated with a 4.5\% decrease in all-cause mortality risk [HR 0.955 (95\% CI 0.928-0.983)]. Non-linear curves showed the lowest mortality risk at the BMI of around 28.0\>kg/m2, suggesting that optimal BMI for the oldest-old may be around overweight or mild obesity. Positive monotonic causal associations were observed between WC and all-cause mortality [HR 1.108 (95\% CI 1.036-1.185) per 5\>cm increase], CVD mortality [HR 1.193 (95\% CI 1.064-1.337)], and non-CVD mortality [HR 1.110 (95\% CI 1.016-1.212)]. The joint effect analyses indicated that the lowest risk was observed among those with higher BMI and lower WC. CONCLUSIONS: Among the oldest-old, opposite causal associations of BMI and WC with mortality were observed, and a body figure with higher BMI and lower WC could substantially decrease the mortality risk. Guidelines for the weight management should be cautiously designed and implemented among the oldest-old people, considering distinct roles of BMI and WC.},

  abstract = {The Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reports that stroke remains a leading cause of death, with ischemic stroke (IS) presenting significant challenges in screening, prevention, and treatment. We explored the causal effects of 1,400 plasma metabolites on IS outcomes using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. We assessed causal relationships between IS and 11 common clinical risk factors and further examined these relationships for metabolites. Mediation analysis identified mechanisms for metabolites affecting both IS and its risk factors. Finally, a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) MR analysis evaluated the side effects and additional indications of IS-associated metabolites across 3,948 phenotypes from the UKBB GWAS. Nineteen metabolites showed a causal relationship with IS. MR analysis confirmed body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as risk factors for IS. Among 136 metabolites associated with at least one IS risk factor, 132 were linked to risk factors but not directly to IS. BMI, DBP, and coffee intake mediated the causal relationship between IS and the levels of 1-stearoyl-GPG (18:0), 1-oleoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPE (18:1/18:2), Octadecadienedioate (C18:2-DC), and X-24,951. Phe-MR analysis indicated that these metabolites were protective and affected other indications similarly to IS. Our findings reveal causal pathways and identify four potential biomarkers for IS, providing new insights for its screening, prevention, and treatment.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess whether weight loss interventions for adults with obesity affect all cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and body weight. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using random effects, estimating risk ratios, and mean differences. Heterogeneity investigated using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. Quality of evidence assessed by GRADE criteria. Data sources Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and full texts in our trials' registry for data not evident in databases. Authors were contacted for unpublished data. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies RCTs of dietary interventions targeting weight loss, with or without exercise advice or programmes, for adults with obesity and follow-up {$\geq$}1 year. Results 54 RCTs with 30 206 participants were identified. All but one trial evaluated low fat, weight reducing diets. For the primary outcome, high quality evidence showed that weight loss interventions decrease all cause mortality (34 trials, 685 events; risk ratio 0.82, 95\% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.95), with six fewer deaths per 1000 participants (95\% confidence interval two to 10). For other primary outcomes moderate quality evidence showed an effect on cardiovascular mortality (eight trials, 134 events; risk ratio 0.93, 95\% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.31), and very low quality evidence showed an effect on cancer mortality (eight trials, 34 events; risk ratio 0.58, 95\% confidence interval 0.30 to 1.11). Twenty four trials (15 176 participants) reported high quality evidence on participants developing new cardiovascular events (1043 events; risk ratio 0.93, 95\% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.04). Nineteen trials (6330 participants) provided very low quality evidence on participants developing new cancers (103 events; risk ratio 0.92, 95\% confidence interval 0.63 to 1.36). Conclusions Weight reducing diets, usually low in fat and saturated fat, with or without exercise advice or programmes, may reduce premature all cause mortality in adults with obesity.

Multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis identified 237 loci attaining stringent genome-wide significance (P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-9), which were delineated to 338 distinct association signals. Fine-mapping of these signals was enhanced by the increased sample size and expanded population diversity of the multi-ancestry meta-analysis, which localized 54.4\% of T2D associations to a single variant with {$>$}50\% posterior probability. This improved fine-mapping enabled systematic assessment of candidate causal genes and molecular mechanisms through which T2D associations are mediated, laying the foundations for functional investigations. Multi-ancestry genetic risk scores enhanced transferability of T2D prediction across diverse populations. Our study provides a step toward more effective clinical translation of T2D GWAS to improve global health for all, irrespective of genetic background.},

We propose a method, `Slope-Hunter', that uses model-based clustering to identify and utilise the class of variants only affecting the phenotype to estimate the adjustment factor, assuming this class explains more variation in the phenotype than any other variant classes. Simulation studies show that our approach eliminates the bias and outperforms alternatives even in the presence of genetic correlation. In a study of fasting blood insulin levels (FI) conditional on body mass index, we eliminate paradoxical associations of the underweight loci: COBLLI; PPARG with increased FI, and reveal an association for the locus rs1421085 (FTO). In an analysis of a case-only study for breast cancer mortality, a single region remains associated with more pronounced results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on the association of obesity with both hospitalization and mortality in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), especially in the real-world ambulatory setting. We hypothesized that increasing body-mass index (BMI) in ambulatory heart failure with preserved ejection fraction would have a protective effect on these patients leading to decreased mortality and hospitalizations. METHODS: We studied the relationship between BMI and the time to all-cause mortality, time to heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and time to all-cause hospitalization over a 2-year follow-up in a national cohort of 2501 ambulatory HFpEF patients at 153 Veterans Affairs medical centers. RESULTS: Compared with normal BMI, overweight (HR 0.72; 95\%\,CI 0.57-0.91), obesity class I (HR 0.59; 95\%\,CI 0.45-0.77), obesity class II (HR 0.56; 95\%\,CI 0.40-0.77), and obesity class III (HR 0.53; 95\%\,CI 0.36-0.77) were associated with improved survival after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities. In contrast, the time to HF hospitalization showed an inverse relationship, with shorter time to HF hospitalization with increasing BMI compared with normal BMI; overweight (adjusted HR 1.30; 95\%\,CI 0.88-1.90), obesity class I (HR 1.57; 95\%\,CI 1.05-2.34), obesity class II (HR 1.79; 95\%\,CI 1.15-2.78), and obesity class III (HR 1.96; 95\%\,CI 1.23-3.12). However, time to first all-cause hospitalization was not significantly different by BMI groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a large, national ambulatory HFpEF cohort, despite the presence of the obesity paradox with respect to survival, increasing BMI was independently associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization and similar risk of all-cause hospitalization. Future longer-term prospective trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of weight loss on morbidity and mortality, in patients with severe obesity and HFpEF are needed.},

There are sparse data on associations between severe obesity and inflammatory biomarkers in adolescence; most are cross-sectional and limited to acute phase reactants. Here, we investigate associations between adiposity measures and inflammatory biomarkers in children and adolescents with severe obesity both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Methods From the Childhood Overweight Biorepository of Australia (COBRA) study, a total of n~=~262 participants, mean age 11.5 years (SD 3.5) with obesity had measures of adiposity (body mass index, BMI; \%~above the 95th BMI-centile, \%{$>$}95th BMI-centile; waist circumference, WC; waist/height ratio, WtH; \%~total body fat, \%BF; \%~truncal body fat, \%TF) and inflammation biomarkers (glycoprotein acetyls, GlycA; high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, hsCRP; white blood cell count, WBC; and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, NLR) assessed at baseline. Ninety-eight individuals at mean age of 15.9 years (3.7) participated in a follow-up study 5.6 (2.1) years later. Sixty-two individuals had longitudinal data. Linear regression models, adjusted for age and sex for cross-sectional analyses were applied. To estimate longitudinal associations between change in adiposity measures with inflammation biomarkers, models were adjusted for baseline measures of adiposity and inflammation. Results All adiposity measures were cross-sectionally associated with GlycA, hsCRP and WBC at both time points. Change in BMI, \%{$>$}95th BMI-centile, WC, WtH and \%TF were associated with concomitant change in GlycA and WBC, but not in hsCRP and NLR. Conclusion GlycA and WBC but not hsCRP and NLR may be useful in assessing adiposity-related severity of chronic inflammation over time.},

A central challenge in this area is the development of powerful multipoint methods that can detect causal variants that have not been directly genotyped. We propose a coherent analysis framework that treats the problem as one involving missing or uncertain genotypes. Central to our approach is a model-based imputation method for inferring genotypes at observed or unobserved SNPs, leading to improved power over existing methods for multipoint association mapping. Using real genome-wide association study data, we show that our approach (i) is accurate and well calibrated, (ii) provides detailed views of associated regions that facilitate follow-up studies and (iii) can be used to validate and correct data at genotyped markers. A notable future use of our method will be to boost power by combining data from genome-wide scans that use different SNP sets.},

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists have shown cardioprotective effects in early clinical studies of patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status. Objective: To test whether therapy with a GLP-1 agonist improves clinical stability following hospitalization for acute heart failure. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of patients with established heart failure and reduced LVEF who were recently hospitalized. Patients were enrolled between August 2013 and March 2015 at 24 US sites. Interventions: The GLP-1 agonist liraglutide (n = 154) or placebo (n = 146) via a daily subcutaneous injection; study drug was advanced to a dosage of 1.8mg/d during the first 30 days as tolerated and continued for 180 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a global rank score in which all patients, regardless of treatment assignment, were ranked across 3 hierarchical tiers: time to death, time to rehospitalization for heart failure, and time-averaged proportional change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level from baseline to 180 days. Higher values indicate better health (stability). Exploratory secondary outcomes included primary end point components, cardiac structure and function, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, and combined events. Results: Among the 300 patients whowere randomized (median age, 61 years [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 52-68 years]; 64 [21\%] women; 178 [59\%] with type 2 diabetes; median LVEF of 25\% [IQR, 19\%-33\%]; median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2049 pg/mL [IQR, 1054-4235 pg/mL]), 271 completed the study. Compared with placebo, liraglutide had no significant effect on the primary end point (mean rank of 146 for the liraglutide group vs 156 for the placebo group, P = .31). Therewere no significant between-group differences in the number of deaths (19 [12\%] in the liraglutide group vs 16 [11\%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 1.10 [95\%CI, 0.57-2.14]; P = .78) or rehospitalizations for heart failure (63 [41\%] vs 50 [34\%], respectively; hazard ratio, 1.30 [95\%CI, 0.89-1.88]; P = .17) or for the exploratory secondary end points. Prespecified subgroup analyses in patients with diabetes did not reveal any significant between-group differences. The number of investigator-reported hyperglycemic eventswas 16 (10\%) in the liraglutide group vs 27 (18\%) in the placebo group and hypoglycemic eventswere infrequent (2 [1\%] vs 4 [3\%], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients recently hospitalized with heart failure and reduced LVEF, the use of liraglutide did not lead to greater posthospitalization clinical stability. These findings do not support the use of liraglutide in this clinical situation.},

  abstract = {Abnormal cardiac metabolism contributes to the pathophysiology of advanced heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists have shown cardioprotective effects in early clinical studies of patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status.To test whether therapy with a GLP-1 agonist improves clinical stability following hospitalization for acute heart failure.Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of patients with established heart failure and reduced LVEF who were recently hospitalized. Patients were enrolled between August 2013 and March 2015 at 24 US sites.The GLP-1 agonist liraglutide (n\,=\,154) or placebo (n\,=\,146) via a daily subcutaneous injection; study drug was advanced to a dosage of 1.8 mg/d during the first 30 days as tolerated and continued for 180 days.The primary end point was a global rank score in which all patients, regardless of treatment assignment, were ranked across 3 hierarchical tiers: time to death, time to rehospitalization for heart failure, and time-averaged proportional change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level from baseline to 180 days. Higher values indicate better health (stability). Exploratory secondary outcomes included primary end point components, cardiac structure and function, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, and combined events.Among the 300 patients who were randomized (median age, 61 years [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 52-68 years]; 64 [21\%] women; 178 [59\%] with type 2 diabetes; median LVEF of 25\% [IQR, 19\%-33\%]; median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2049 pg/mL [IQR, 1054-4235 pg/mL]), 271 completed the study. Compared with placebo, liraglutide had no significant effect on the primary end point (mean rank of 146 for the liraglutide group vs 156 for the placebo group, P\,=\,.31). There were no significant between-group differences in the number of deaths (19 [12\%] in the liraglutide group vs 16 [11\%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 1.10 [95\% CI, 0.57-2.14]; P\,=\,.78) or rehospitalizations for heart failure (63 [41\%] vs 50 [34\%], respectively; hazard ratio, 1.30 [95\% CI, 0.89-1.88]; P\,=\,.17) or for the exploratory secondary end points. Prespecified subgroup analyses in patients with diabetes did not reveal any significant between-group differences. The number of investigator-reported hyperglycemic events was 16 (10\%) in the liraglutide group vs 27 (18\%) in the placebo group and hypoglycemic events were infrequent (2 [1\%] vs 4 [3\%], respectively). Among patients recently hospitalized with heart failure and reduced LVEF, the use of liraglutide did not lead to greater posthospitalization clinical stability. These findings do not support the use of liraglutide in this clinical situation.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01800968},

As no effective medical interventions are available, osteoarthritis often progresses to the end stage, in which only surgical options such as total joint replacement are available. A more thorough understanding of genetic influences of osteoarthritis is essential to develop targeted personalized approaches to treatment, ideally long before the end stage is reached. To date, there have been no large multiancestry genetic studies of osteoarthritis. Here, we leveraged the unique resources of 484,374 participants in the Million Veteran Program and UK Biobank to address this gap. Analyses included participants of European, African, Asian and Hispanic descent. We discovered osteoarthritis-associated genetic variation at 10 loci and replicated findings from previous osteoarthritis studies. We also present evidence that some osteoarthritis-associated regions are robust to population ancestry. Drug repurposing analyses revealed enrichment of targets of several medication classes and provide potential insight into the etiology of beneficial effects of antiepileptics on osteoarthritis pain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for adult coronary heart disease and is increasing in prevalence among youths as well as adults. Results regarding the association of obesity with atherosclerosis are conflicting, particularly when analyses account for other risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study collected arteries, blood, and other tissue from approximately 3000 persons aged 15 to 34 years dying of external causes and autopsied in forensic laboratories. We measured gross atherosclerotic lesions in the right coronary artery (RCA), American Heart Association (AHA) lesion grade in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), serum lipid concentrations, serum thiocyanate (for smoking), intimal thickness of renal arteries (for hypertension), glycohemoglobin (for hyperglycemia), and adiposity by body mass index (BMI) and thickness of the panniculus adiposus. BMI in young men was associated with both fatty streaks and raised lesions in the RCA and with AHA grade and stenosis in the LAD. The effect of obesity (BMI{$>$}30 kg/m(2)) on RCA raised lesions was greater in young men with a thick panniculus adiposus. Obesity was associated with non-HDL and HDL (inversely) cholesterol concentrations, smoking (inversely), hypertension, and glycohemoglobin concentration, and these variables accounted for approximately 15\% of the effect of obesity on coronary atherosclerosis in young men. BMI was not associated with coronary atherosclerosis in young women although there was trend among those with a thick panniculus adiposus. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with accelerated coronary atherosclerosis in adolescent and young adult men. These observations support the current emphasis on controlling obesity to prevent adult coronary heart disease.},

OBJECTIVE: To perform meta-analyses that assess the CV and kidney outcomes of all 4 available SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed from January 1, 2015, to January 31, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: One hundred forty-five records were initially identified; 137 were excluded because of study design or topic of interest. As a result, a total of 6 randomized, placebo-controlled CV and kidney outcomes trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes were identified, with contributory data from 9 publications. All analyses were conducted on the total patient population of these trials. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Standardized data search and abstraction were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement. Data were analyzed using a fixed-effect model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included time to the first event of (1) the composite of major adverse CV events of myocardial infarction, stroke, or CV death, and each component, (2) the composite of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or CV death (HHF/CV death) and each component, and (3) kidney composite outcomes. For outcomes in the overall trial populations and in selected subgroups, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs were pooled and meta-analyzed across trials. RESULTS: Data from 6 trials comprised 46\,969 unique patients with type 2 diabetes, including 31\,116 (66.2\%) with atherosclerotic CV disease. The mean (SD) age of all trial participants was 63.7 (7.9) years; 30 939 (65.9\%) were men, and 36 849 (78.5\%) were White. The median number of participants per trial was 8246 (range, 4401-17\,160). Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse CV events (HR, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.85-0.95; Q statistic, P\,=\,.27), HHF/CV death (HR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.84; Q statistic, P\,=\,.09), and kidney outcomes (HR, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.56-0.70; Q statistic, P\,=\,.09), with no significant heterogeneity of associations with outcome. Associated risk reduction for HHF was consistent across the trials (HR, 0.68; 95\% CI, 0.61-0.76; I2\,=\,0.0\%), whereas significant heterogeneity of associations with outcome was observed for CV death (HR, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.78-0.93; Q statistic, P\,=\,.02; I2\,=\,64.3\%). The presence or absence of atherosclerotic CV disease did not modify the association with outcomes for major adverse CV events (HR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.84-0.95 and HR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.07, respectively; P\,=\,.63 for interaction), with similar absence of associations with outcome modification by prevalent atherosclerotic CV disease for HHF/CV death (P\,=\,.62 for interaction), HHF (P\,=\,.26 for interaction), or kidney outcomes (P\,=\,.73 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this meta-analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse CV events; in addition, results suggest significant heterogeneity in associations with CV death. The largest benefit across the class was for an associated reduction in risk for HHF and kidney outcomes, with benefits for HHF risk being the most consistent observation across the trials.},

For outcomes in the overall trial populations and in selected subgroups, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs were pooled and meta-analyzed across trials. RESULTS: Data from 6 trials comprised 46\,969 unique patients with type 2 diabetes, including 31\,116 (66.2\%) with atherosclerotic CV disease. The mean (SD) age of all trial participants was 63.7 (7.9) years; 30 939 (65.9\%) were men, and 36 849 (78.5\%) were White. The median number of participants per trial was 8246 (range, 4401-17\,160). Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse CV events (HR, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.85-0.95; Q statistic, P\,=\,.27), HHF/CV death (HR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.84; Q statistic, P\,=\,.09), and kidney outcomes (HR, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.56-0.70; Q statistic, P\,=\,.09), with no significant heterogeneity of associations with outcome. Associated risk reduction for HHF was consistent across the trials (HR, 0.68; 95\% CI, 0.61-0.76; I2\,=\,0.0\%), whereas significant heterogeneity of associations with outcome was observed for CV death (HR, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.78-0.93; Q statistic, P\,=\,.02; I2\,=\,64.3\%). The presence or absence of atherosclerotic CV disease did not modify the association with outcomes for major adverse CV events (HR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.84-0.95 and HR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.07, respectively; P\,=\,.63 for interaction), with similar absence of associations with outcome modification by prevalent atherosclerotic CV disease for HHF/CV death (P\,=\,.62 for interaction), HHF (P\,=\,.26 for interaction), or kidney outcomes (P\,=\,.73 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this meta-analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse CV events; in addition, results suggest significant heterogeneity in associations with CV death. The largest benefit across the class was for an associated reduction in risk for HHF and kidney outcomes, with benefits for HHF risk being the most consistent observation across the trials.},

  abstract = {Obesity is a recognized risk factor for heart failure. People with similar weights may have different metabolic health. Notably, insulin resistance is a hallmark of obesity and a feature of heart failure. We aimed to evaluate the effects of obesity and metabolic health status on subclinical left cardiac function. We also investigated whether insulin resistance (TyG index) plays a role in BMI-linked subclinical left cardiac dysfunction. The study involved 403 volunteers. Hierarchical multiple regression models were used to assess associations between obesity, metabolic health, and overall subclinical left cardiac function. Mediating analysis was used to explore the role of the TyG index in the association between BMI and left cardiac function. Finally, ROC analysis was performed to explore the predictive value of the TyG index in subclinical left cardiac dysfunction. The correlation analysis showed that metabolic unhealth increased the risk of subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction; obesity was associated with an increased risk of global left cardiac dysfunction regardless of metabolic health status. The TyG index mediated 25\% of the associations between BMI and Left atrial (LA) functional parameters. ROC analysis exhibited that the TyG index can be used as a predictor of LA dysfunction (AUC\,=\,0.63), and the optimal cut-off point for the TyG index is 9.33. Even a "non-obese metabolically unhealthy" is a detrimental state of early LV function; obesity remains a major risk factor for global subclinical left cardiac dysfunction. Using the TyG index could allow early identification of individuals at high risk of subclinical left cardiac dysfunction.Registration number: ChiCTR2200057991; Date of registration: 2022-03-25.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Lost glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) function affects human physiology. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to identify coding nonsynonymous GLP1R variants in Danish individuals to link their in vitro phenotypes and clinical phenotypic associations. METHODS: We sequenced GLP1R in 8642 Danish individuals with type 2 diabetes or normal glucose tolerance and examined the ability of nonsynonymous variants to bind GLP-1 and to signal in transfected cells via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation and {$\beta$}-arrestin recruitment. We performed a cross-sectional study between the burden of loss-of-signaling (LoS) variants and cardiometabolic phenotypes in 2930 patients with type 2 diabetes and 5712 participants in a population-based cohort. Furthermore, we studied the association between cardiometabolic phenotypes and the burden of the LoS variants and 60 partly overlapping predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) GLP1R variants found in 330 566 unrelated White exome-sequenced participants in the UK Biobank cohort. RESULTS: We identified 36 nonsynonymous variants in GLP1R, of which 10 had a statistically significant loss in GLP-1-induced cAMP signaling compared to wild-type. However, no association was observed between the LoS variants and type 2 diabetes, although LoS variant carriers had a minor increased fasting plasma glucose level. Moreover, pLoF variants from the UK Biobank also did not reveal substantial cardiometabolic associations, despite a small effect on glycated hemoglobin A1c. CONCLUSION: Since no homozygous LoS nor pLoF variants were identified and heterozygous carriers had similar cardiometabolic phenotype as noncarriers, we conclude that GLP-1R may be of particular importance in human physiology, due to a potential evolutionary intolerance of harmful homozygous GLP1R variants.},

Here we report a multi-ancestry GWAS of MD, adding data from 21 cohorts with 88,316 MD cases and 902,757 controls to previously reported data. This analysis used a range of measures to define MD and included samples of African (36\% of effective sample size), East Asian (26\%) and South Asian (6\%) ancestry and Hispanic/Latin American participants (32\%). The multi-ancestry GWAS identified 53 significantly associated novel loci. For loci from GWAS in European ancestry samples, fewer than expected were transferable to other ancestry groups. Fine mapping benefited from additional sample diversity. A transcriptome-wide association study identified 205 significantly associated novel genes. These findings suggest that, for MD, increasing ancestral and global diversity in genetic studies may be particularly important to ensure discovery of core genes and inform about transferability of findings.},

  abstract = {AIMS: A substantial proportion of patients with heart failure have preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HF-PEF). Previous studies have reported mixed results whether survival is similar to those patients with heart failure and reduced EF (HF-REF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared survival in patients with HF-PEF with that in patients with HF-REF in a meta-analysis using individual patient data. Preserved EF was defined as an EF {$\geq$} 50\%. The 31 studies included 41 972 patients: 10 347 with HF-PEF and 31 625 with HF-REF. Compared with patients with HF-REF, those with HF-PEF were older (mean age 71 vs. 66 years), were more often women (50 vs. 28\%), and have a history of hypertension (51 vs. 41\%). Ischaemic aetiology was less common (43 vs. 59\%) in patients with HF-PEF. There were 121 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 117, 126] deaths per 1000 patient-years in those with HF-PEF and 141 (95\% CI: 138, 144) deaths per 1000 patient-years in those with HF-REF. Patients with HF-PEF had lower mortality than those with HF-REF (adjusted for age, gender, aetiology, and history of hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation); hazard ratio 0.68 (95\% CI: 0.64, 0.71). The risk of death did not increase notably until EF fell below 40\%. CONCLUSION: Patients with HF-PEF have a lower risk of death than patients with HF-REF, and this difference is seen regardless of age, gender, and aetiology of HF. However, absolute mortality is still high in patients with HF-PEF highlighting the need for a treatment to improve prognosis.},

  abstract = {Introduction Obesity is a complex disease associated with excessive fat accumulation and numerous metabolic complications. So far, many factors leading to the development of this disorder have been identified, including genetic susceptibility. Various studies linked GLP1R variants with anthropometric and metabolic parameters, suggesting the role of the variation in this gene in metabolic health. Objective The aim of this study is to investigate the association of two single nucleotide variants of GLP1R gene, rs2268641 and rs6923761, with excessive weight, metabolic syndrome, anthropometric measurements and selected metabolic parameters. Methods Normal-weight subjects (n= 340, control group) and subjects with excessive body mass (n = 600, study group) participated in this study. For all participants, anthropometric measurements and metabolic parameters were collected, and genotyping of the two single nucleotide variants of GLP1R gene, rs2268641 and rs6923761, was performed using the high-resolution melting curve analysis. Results Significant differences in the genotype distribution of rs2268641 were found, where homozygous TT genotype was significantly less frequent in the study group with excessive body mass (OR=0.66; p=0.0298). For rs6923761, A allele and homozygous AA genotype were significantly more frequent in the study group with excessive weight than in the control group (OR=1.27; p=0.0239 and OR=1.69; p=0.0205, respectively). The association of studied variants with metabolic parameters was found for rs6923761. For this variant, AA carriers had higher body mass in comparison to GG carriers (p=0.0246), and AA carriers had higher glucose concentration in comparison to AG carriers (p=0.0498). We did not find an association of rs2268641 and rs6923761 with metabolic syndrome. Conclusion In our study, AA carriers of rs6923761 had higher risk of excessive body mass, whereas TT carriers of rs2268641 had lower risk of being overweight. Moreover, homozygous carriers of the minor allele of rs6923761 had higher glucose concentration in comparison to heterozygous subjects. None of the studied variants were associated with metabolic syndrome in the studied population.},

Methods to detect the presence of index event bias include the use of negative controls, a comparison of associations between risk factors for incidence in individuals with and without the disease, and an inspection of Miami plots.

It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.~Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

  abstract = {The liver plays an important role in insulin-regulated glucose homoeostasis. To study the function of the PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1) signalling pathway in mediating insulin's actions in the liver, we employed CRE recombinase/loxP technology to generate L(liver)-PDK1-/- mice, which lack expression of PDK1 in hepatocytes and in which insulin failed to induce activation of PKB in liver. The L-PDK1-/- mice were not insulin-intolerant, possessed normal levels of blood glucose and insulin under normal feeding conditions, but were markedly glucose-intolerant when injected with glucose. The L-PDK1-/- mice also possessed 10-fold lower levels of hepatic glycogen compared with control littermates, and were unable to normalize their blood glucose levels within 2~h after injection of insulin. The glucose intolerance of the L-PDK1-/- mice may be due to an inability of glucose to suppress hepatic glucose output through the gluconeogenic pathway, since the mRNA encoding hepatic PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), G6Pase (glucose-6-phosphatase) and SREBP1 (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1), which regulate gluconeogenesis, are no longer controlled by feeding. Furthermore, three other insulin-controlled genes, namely IGFBP1 (insulin-like-growth-factor-binding protein-1), IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) and glucokinase, were regulated abnormally by feeding in the liver of PDK1-deficient mice. Finally, the L-PDK1-/- mice died between 4--16~weeks of age due to liver failure. These results establish that the PDK1 signalling pathway plays an important role in regulating glucose homoeostasis and controlling expression of insulin-regulated genes. They suggest that a deficiency of the PDK1 pathway in the liver could contribute to development of diabetes, as well as to liver failure.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate whether obesity in the absence of metabolic abnormalities might be a relatively benign condition in relation to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: The results of previous studies are conflicting for AMI and largely unknown for HF, and the role of the duration of obesity has not been investigated. METHODS: In a population-based prospective cohort study, a total of 61,299 men and women free of cardiovascular disease were classified according to body mass index (BMI) and metabolic status at baseline. BMI also was measured 10 and 30 years before baseline for 27,196 participants. RESULTS: During 12 years of follow-up, 2,547 participants had a first AMI, and 1,201 participants had a first HF. Compared with being normal weight (BMI {$<$}25 kg/m(2)) and metabolically healthy, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for AMI was 1.1 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9 to 1.4) among obese (BMI~{$\geq$}30 kg/m(2)) and metabolically healthy participants and 2.0 (95\% CI: 1.7 to 2.3) among obese and metabolically unhealthy participants. We found similar results for severe (BMI~{$\geq$}35 kg/m(2)), long-lasting ({$>$}30 years), and abdominal obesity stratified for metabolic status. For HF, the HRs associated with obesity were 1.7 (95\% CI: 1.3 to 2.3) and 1.7 (95\% CI: 1.4 to 2.2) for metabolically healthy and unhealthy participants, respectively. Severe and long-lasting obesity were particularly harmful in relation to HF, regardless of metabolic status. CONCLUSIONS: In relation to AMI, obesity without metabolic abnormalities did not confer substantial excess risk, not even for severe or long-lasting obesity. For HF, even metabolically healthy obesity was associated with increased risk, particularly for long-lasting or severe obesity.},

METHODS: We conducted a series of systematic literature searches on the pharmacogenetics of HF therapy to assess the current knowledge on this field. RESULTS: Existing data related to HF pharmacogenomics are still limited. The ADRB1 gene is a likely candidate to predict response to {$\beta$}-blockers. Moreover, the cytochrome P450 2D6 coding gene (CYP2D6) clearly affects the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, although the clinical impact of this association remains to be established. CONCLUSION: Given the rising prevalence of HF and related costs, a more personalized use of HF drugs could have a remarkable benefit for patients, caregivers and healthcare systems.},

  abstract = {Natriuretic peptide [NP; B-type NP (BNP), N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), and midregional proANP (MR-proANP)] concentrations are quantitative plasma biomarkers for the presence and severity of haemodynamic cardiac stress and heart failure (HF). End-diastolic wall stress, intracardiac filling pressures, and intracardiac volumes seem to be the dominant triggers. This paper details the most important indications for NPs and highlights 11 key principles underlying their clinical use shown below. NPs should always be used in conjunction with all other clinical information. NPs are reasonable surrogates for intracardiac volumes and filling pressures. NPs should be measured in all patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of HF such as dyspnoea and/or fatigue, as their use facilitates the early diagnosis and risk stratification of HF. NPs have very high diagnostic accuracy in discriminating HF from other causes of dyspnoea: the higher the NP, the higher the likelihood that dyspnoea is caused by HF. Optimal NP cut-off concentrations for the diagnosis of acute HF (very high filling pressures) in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnoea are higher compared with those used in the diagnosis of chronic HF in patients with dyspnoea on exertion (mild increase in filling pressures at rest). Obese patients have lower NP concentrations, mandating the use of lower cut-off concentrations (about 50\% lower). In stable HF patients, but also in patients with other cardiac disorders such as myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation or pulmonary embolism, NP concentrations have high prognostic accuracy for death and HF hospitalization. Screening with NPs for the early detection of relevant cardiac disease including left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular risk factors may help to identify patients at increased risk, therefore allowing targeted preventive measures to prevent HF. BNP, NT-proBNP and MR-proANP have comparable diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. In patients with shock, NPs cannot be used to identify cause (e.g. cardiogenic vs. septic shock), but remain prognostic. NPs cannot identify the underlying cause of HF and, therefore, if elevated, must always be used in conjunction with cardiac imaging.},

However, metabolite profiles induced by different weight loss maintenance diets and underlying longer term weight loss maintenance remain unknown. Herein, we investigated after-weight-loss metabolic signatures of two isocaloric 24-wk weight maintenance diets differing in satiety value due to dietary fibre, protein and fat contents and identified metabolite features that associated with successful weight loss maintenance. Methods Non-targeted LC-MS metabolomics approach was used to analyse plasma metabolites of 79 women and men (mean age~{\textpm}~SD 49.7~{\textpm}~9.0 years; BMI 34.2~{\textpm}~2.5~kg/m2) participating in a weight management study. Participants underwent a 7-week very-low-energy diet (VLED) and were thereafter randomised into two groups for a 24-week weight maintenance phase. Higher satiety food (HSF) group consumed high-fibre, high-protein, and low-fat products, while lower satiety food (LSF) group consumed isocaloric low-fibre products with average protein and fat content as a part of their weight maintenance diets. Plasma metabolites were analysed before the VLED and before and after the weight maintenance phase. Metabolite features discriminating HSF and LSF groups were annotated. We also analysed metabolite features that discriminated participants who maintained {$\geq$}10\% weight loss (HWM) and participants who maintained {$<$}10\% weight loss (LWM) at the end of the study, irrespective of the diet. Finally, we assessed robust linear regression between metabolite features and anthropometric and food group variables. Results We annotated 126 metabolites that discriminated the HSF and LSF groups and HWM and LWM groups (p~{$<~$}0.05). Compared to LSF, the HSF group had lower levels of several amino acids, e.g. glutamine, arginine, and glycine, short-, medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines (CARs), odd- and even-chain lysoglycerophospholipids, and higher levels of fatty amides. Compared to LWM, the HWM group in general showed higher levels of glycerophospholipids with a saturated long-chain and a C20:4 fatty acid tail, and unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs). Changes in several saturated odd- and even-chain LPCs and LPEs and fatty amides were associated with the intake of many food groups, particularly grain and dairy products. Increase in several (lyso)glycerophospholipids was associated with decrease in body weight and adiposity. Increased short- and medium-chain CARs were related to decreased body fat-free mass. Conclusions Our results show that isocaloric weight maintenance diets differing in dietary fibre, protein, and fat content affected amino acid and lipid metabolism. Increased abundances of several phospholipid species and FFAs were related with greater weight loss maintenance. Our findings indicate common and distinct metabolites for weight and dietary related variables in the context of weight reduction and weight management.

  abstract = {While obesity is associated with a variety of complications including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and premature death, observational studies have also found that obesity and increasing body mass index (BMI) can be linked with improved survival in certain patient populations, including those with conditions marked by protein-energy wasting and dysmetabolism that ultimately lead to cachexia. The latter observations have been reported in various clinical settings including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and have been described as the "obesity paradox" or "reverse epidemiology", engendering controversy. While some have attributed the obesity paradox to residual confounding in an effort to "debunk" these observations, recent experimental discoveries provide biologically plausible mechanisms in which higher BMI can be linked to longevity in certain groups of patients. In addition, sophisticated epidemiologic methods that extensively adjusted for confounding have found that the obesity paradox remains robust in ESRD. Furthermore, novel hypotheses suggest that weight loss and cachexia can be linked to adverse outcomes including cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, sudden death and poor outcomes. Therefore, the survival benefit observed in obese ESRD patients can at least partly be derived from mechanisms that protect against inefficient energy utilization, cachexia and protein-energy wasting. Given that in ESRD patients, treatment of traditional risk factors has failed to alter outcomes, detailed translational studies of the obesity paradox may help identify innovative pathways that can be targeted to improve survival. We have reviewed recent clinical evidence detailing the association of BMI with outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease, including ESRD, and discuss potential mechanisms underlying the obesity paradox with potential for clinical applicability.},

The relationship between obesity and cardiovascular diseases is complex and not fully understood. While the risk of developing heart failure has been shown to be higher in patients who are obese, there is a survival advantage for obese and overweight patients compared with normal weight or low weight patients. This phenomenon was first described by Horwich et al. and was subsequently confirmed in other large trials. The advantage exists irrespective of the type, aetiology, or stage of heart failure. Patients with morbid obesity (body mass index {$>$}40~kg/m2), however, do not have the same survival advantage of their obese counterparts. There are several alternative indices of obesity available that may be more accurate than body mass index. The role of weight loss in patients with heart failure is unclear; thus, providing sound clinical advice to patients remains difficult. Future prospective trials designed to evaluate the link between obesity and heart failure will help us understand more fully this complex relationship.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obese humans are reported to have increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may also be accompanied by increased MSNA. Because there is a high prevalence of OSA in obese humans, it is possible that high MSNA reported in obese subjects may in fact reflect the presence of OSA in these subjects. We tested the hypothesis that obesity, per se, in the absence of OSA, is not accompanied by increased MSNA. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured MSNA in 25 healthy normal-weight subjects and 30 healthy sedentary obese subjects. All subjects were screened by history and examination to exclude subjects with OSA or hypertension. OSA was further excluded by overnight polysomnographic studies. Despite careful screening, polysomnography revealed that 1 of 25 normal-weight subjects and 9 of 30 obese subjects had occult OSA (P=0.015). MSNA was similar in normal-weight subjects (41+/-3 bursts per 100 heartbeats) and obese subjects without sleep apnea (42+/-3 bursts per 100 heartbeats, P=0.99). MSNA in the 9 obese subjects with occult OSA was 61+/-8 bursts per 100 heartbeats, which was higher than MSNA in normal-weight subjects without sleep apnea (P=0.02) and higher than MSNA in obese subjects without sleep apnea (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity alone, in the absence of OSA, is not accompanied by increased sympathetic activity to muscle blood vessels.},

  abstract = {Objective Hospital-related indicators are used to prioritise, benchmark and monitor certain healthcare components to improve quality. This study aimed to determine the hospital admissions profile in England and Wales between 1999 and 2019. Design Ecological study. Setting A population-based study of hospitalised patients in England and Wales. Participants All patients of all ages and genders who were hospitalised in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and NHS-funded independent sector hospitals. Outcome measure Hospital admission rates in England and Wales related to various diseases/causes, which were identified using the diagnostic codes (A00-Z99). Results There was a 48.5\% rise in hospital admission rates from 246\,366.7 (95\% CI 246 249.8 to 246 483.7) in 1999 to 365 858.7 (95\% CI 365 736.3 to 365 981.2) in 2019 per million persons (p{$<$}0.05). The most common causes of hospital admissions were diseases of the digestive system; symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings; and neoplasms, which accounted for 11.5\%, 11.4\% and 10.5\%, respectively. The age range of 15--59 years accounted for 43.4\% of all hospital admissions. Around 56.0\% of all hospital admissions were by female patients. In comparison to 1999, the hospital admission rate for males grew by 53.7\%, from 218\,363.7 (95\% CI 218 203.2 to 218 524.3) to 335\,618.9 (95\% CI 335 448.1 to 335 789.6) per million persons in 2019. When compared with 1999, the hospital admission rate for females increased by 44.7\%, rising from 273\,032.5 (95\% CI 272 863.5 to 273 201.5) to 395\,154.6 (95\% CI 394 979.9 to 395 329.4) per million persons. Conclusion A notable increase was observed in the rate of hospital admissions for all causes in England and Wales. Elderly age and female gender were significant factors that influenced the rate of hospital admissions. Future research is required to identify preventable risk factors for hospital admission.},

  abstract = {Background Obesity is a risk factor for various subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), and stroke. Nevertheless, there are limited comparisons of the associations of obesity with each of these CVD subtypes, particularly regarding the extent to which they are unexplained by traditional CVD mediators. Methods and Results We followed 13~730 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who had a body mass index {$\geq$}18.5~and no CVD at baseline (visit 1, 1987--1989). We compared the association of higher body mass index with incident HF, CHD, and stroke before and after adjusting for traditional CVD mediators (including systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and lipid measures). Over a median follow-up of 23~years, there were 2235 HF events, 1653 CHD events, and 986 strokes. After adjustment for demographics, smoking, physical activity, and alcohol intake, higher body mass index had the strongest association with incident HF among CVD subtypes, with hazard ratios for severe obesity (body mass index {$\geq$}35 versus normal weight) of 3.74 (95\% CI 3.24--4.31) for HF, 2.00 (95\% CI 1.67--2.40) for CHD, and 1.75 (95\% CI 1.40--2.20) for stroke (P{$<$}0.0001 for comparisons of HF versus CHD or stroke). Further adjustment for traditional mediators fully explained the association of higher body mass index with CHD and stroke but not with HF (hazard ratio 2.27, 95\% CI 1.94--2.64). Conclusions The link between obesity and HF was stronger than those for other CVD subtypes and was uniquely unexplained by traditional risk factors. Weight management is likely critical for optimal HF prevention, and nontraditional pathways linking obesity to HF need to be elucidated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess weight is associated with subclinical myocardial damage, as reflected by high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) concentrations, which portends high heart failure risk. However, the association between weight history and myocardial damage is unknown. METHODS: We evaluated 9062 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) visit 4 (1996-1999) participants with a body mass index (BMI) {$\geq$} 18.5 kg/m2 and no previous cardiovascular disease. We cross-tabulated visit 4 ("current") BMI categories of normal weight, overweight, and obese with those at visit 1 (1987-1989) and with BMI categories calculated from self-reported weight at age 25 years. Duration of obesity was calculated in years. A cumulative weight measure of "excess BMI-years" was also calculated [product of mean BMI (centered at 25 kg/m2) over all ARIC time points {\texttimes} follow-up duration]. We used logistic regression to estimate associations of weight history metrics with increased hs-cTnT ({$\geq$}14 ng/L) at visit 4. RESULTS: Overall, 623 individuals (7\%) had increased hs-cTnT at visit 4. Within each current BMI category, previous excess weight was associated with increased hs-cTnT, with the strongest associations for those with past and current obesity [odds ratio (OR), 3.85; 95\% CI, 2.51-5.90 for obesity at age 25 years and visit 4]. Each 10-year longer obesity duration was associated with increased hs-cTnT (OR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.35). Each 100 higher excess BMI-years was also progressively associated with increased hs-cTnT (OR, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.14-1.27). CONCLUSIONS: Previous obesity and greater cumulative weight from young adulthood increase the likelihood of myocardial damage, indicating long-term toxic effects of adiposity on the myocardium and the need for weight maintenance strategies targeting the entire life span.},

  abstract = {Background Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that reduces glycemia as well as blood pressure, body weight, and albuminuria in people with diabetes. We report the effects of treatment with canagliflozin on cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes. Methods The CANVAS Program integrated data from two trials involving a total of 10,142 participants with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Participants in each trial were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin or placebo and were followed for a mean of 188.2 weeks. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Results The mean age of the participants was 63.3 years, 35.8\% were women, the mean duration of diabetes was 13.5 years, and 65.6\% had a history of cardiovascular disease. The rate of the primary outcome was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo (occurring in 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.97; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.02 for superiority). Although on the basis of the prespecified hypothesis testing sequence the renal outcomes are not viewed as statistically significant, the results showed a possible benefit of canagliflozin with respect to the progression of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.79) and the composite outcome of a sustained 40\% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, the need for renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal causes (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.47 to 0.77). Adverse reactions were consistent with the previously reported risks associated with canagliflozin except for an increased risk of amputation (6.3 vs. 3.4 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.97; 95\% CI, 1.41 to 2.75); amputations were primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal. Conclusions In two trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, patients treated with canagliflozin had a lower risk of cardiovascular events than those who received placebo but a greater risk of amputation, primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal.

This approach identified 13 new loci at genome-wide significance, 12 of which were on our previous list of loci meeting the 5\% FDR threshold, thus providing strong support that the remaining loci identified by FDR represent genuine signals. The 304 independent variants associated at 5\% FDR in this study explain 21.2\% of CAD heritability and identify 243 loci that implicate pathways in blood vessel morphogenesis as well as lipid metabolism, nitric oxide signaling and inflammation.},

  abstract = {Background Heart failure is now the commonest reason for hospitalization in Germany (German Federal Statistical Office, 2008). Heart failure will continue to be a central public health issue in the future as the population ages. This article focuses on regional differences, the costs of the disease, and the expected rate of increase in cases in the near future. Methods This analysis is based on diagnosis statistics, cause-of-death statistics, and cost of illness data, as reported by the German Federal Statistical Office. Age- and sex-specific differences are taken into account. Results 2006 was the first year in which heart failure led to more hospital admissions in Germany (317 000) than any other diagnosis. At present, about 141 000 persons in Germany aged 80 and over have heart failure; by the year 2050, it is predicted that more than 350 000 persons in this age group will be affected. The rate of diagnosis of heart failure, its frequency as a cause of death, and the costs associated with it all vary across the individual states of the Federal Republic of Germany. The nationwide cost of heart failure in 2006 was estimated at 2.9 billion euros. Conclusions These findings reveal that heart failure has become more common as an admission diagnosis of hospitalized patients in Germany. Because the population is aging, new concepts for prevention and treatment will be needed in the near future so that the affected patients can continue to receive adequate care.},

RESULTS: Of the remaining (640 participants excluded from original group of 3,075) 2,435 participants (1,081 men, 1,354 women) without coronary heart disease or CHF at baseline, there were 166 confirmed diagnoses of CHF during the median+/-standard deviation (SD) follow-up of 6.1+/-1.4 years. After adjustment for age, race, sex, site, education, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, all adiposity variables (body mass index (BMI), adipose tissue mass, percentage body fat, waist-to-thigh ratio, waist circumference, and visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue) were significant predictors of the development of CHF. In a model that included waist circumference and BMI, waist circumference was associated with incident CHF (hazard ratio (HR)=1.27, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-1.54 per SD increase, P=.02), but BMI was not (HR=1.08, 95\% CI=0.86-1.35). When waist circumference and percentage fat were included together, both variables were significant predictors of CHF (waist: HR=1.17, 95\% CI=1.00-1.36 per SD increase, P=.05; percentage fat: HR=1.47, 95\% CI=1.16-1.87 per SD increase, P=.002). Stepwise adjustment for inflammation, hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus did not decrease the relative risk of a greater waist circumference for the development of CHF (all HR=1.27-1.32, 95\% CI=1.02-1.61 per SD increase). CONCLUSION: Abdominal body fat distribution may be a stronger risk factor for CHF than overall obesity.},

  abstract = {Abstract---Obesity is commonly associated with impaired myocardial contractile function. However, a direct link between these 2 states has not yet been established. There has been an indication that leptin, the product of the human obesity gene, may play a role in obesity-related metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunctions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether leptin exerts any direct cardiac contractile action that may contribute to altered myocardial function. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Contractile responses were evaluated by use of video-based edge detection. Contractile properties analyzed in cells electrically stimulated at 0.5 Hz included peak shortening, time to 90\% peak shortening, time to 90\% relengthening, and fluorescence intensity change. Leptin exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition in myocyte shortening and intracellular Ca2+ change, with maximal inhibitions of 22.4\% and 26.2\%, respectively. Pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor N{$\omega$}-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 {$\mu$}mol/L) blocked leptin-induced inhibition of both peak shortening and fluorescence intensity change. Leptin also stimulated NO synthase activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, as reflected in the dose-related increase in NO accumulation in these cells. Addition of an NO donor (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine [SNAP]) to the medium mimicked the effects of leptin administration. In summary, this study demonstrated a direct action of leptin on cardiomyocyte contraction, possibly through an increased NO production. These data suggest that leptin may play a role in obesity-related cardiac contractile dysfunction.},

Methods and Results We examined the relationship between BMI and the prognosis of Japanese HF patients in the Chronic Heart Failure Analysis and Registry in the Tohoku District (CHART) study. The study sample was 972 Japanese chronic HF patients (mean age, 68.2 {\textpm} 13.5; male 65.2\%). We categorized them into 5 groups; BMI {$<$}18.5, 18.5 to 22.9, 23.0 to 24.9 (reference), 25.0 to 29.9, and {$\geq$}30.0. Using a Cox hazards model, the relationships between BMI and deaths or admission for worsening HF were studied in detail. Mean follow-up period was 3.4 {\textpm} 1.7 years. Multivariate analysis showed that, as compared with reference group (BMI 23.0 to 24.9), hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause death showed a U-shaped association with 1.70 (95\% confidence interval; 1.04--2.76), 1.23 (0.85--1.78), 1.26 (0.84--1.90), and 2.75 (1.51--5.00) among those with BMI{$<$}18.5, 18.5 to 22.9, 25.0 to 29.9, and {$\geq$}30.0, respectively. There were significant and suggestive U-shaped associations between BMI and cardiac-cause death or admission for worsening HF. Conclusions Both high and low BMIs were associated with increased outcomes, suggesting that extreme obesity is not beneficial in improving the prognosis of Japanese chronic HF patients.},

Previous studies have not had adequate statistical power to measure the effects of exercise training on clinical outcomes. Objective To test the efficacy and safety of exercise training among patients with heart failure. Design, Setting, and Patients Multicenter, randomized controlled trial of 2331 medically stable outpatients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Participants in Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) were randomized from April 2003 through February 2007 at 82 centers within the United States, Canada, and France; median follow-up was 30 months. Interventions Usual care plus aerobic exercise training, consisting of 36 supervised sessions followed by home-based training, or usual care alone. Main Outcome Measures Composite primary end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization and prespecified secondary end points of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization. Results The median age was 59 years, 28\% were women, and 37\% had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms. Heart failure etiology was ischemic in 51\%, and median left ventricular ejection fraction was 25\%. Exercise adherence decreased from a median of 95 minutes per week during months 4 through 6 of follow-up to 74 minutes per week during months 10 through 12. A total of 759 patients (65\%) in the exercise training group died or were hospitalized compared with 796 patients (68\%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93 [95\% confidence interval \{Cl\}, 0.84-1.02]; P=.13). There were nonsignificant reductions in the exercise training group for mortality (189 patients [16\%] in the exercise training group vs 198 patients [17\%] in the usual care group; HR, 0.96 [95\% Cl, 0.79-1.17]; P=.7O), cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization (632 [55\%] in the exercise training group vs 677 [58\%] in the usual care group; HR, 0.92 [95\% Cl, 0.83-1.03]; P=.14), and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization (344 [30\%] in the exercise training group vs 393 [34\%] in the usual care group; HR, 0.87 [95\% Cl, 0.75-1.00]; P=.O6). In prespecified supplementary analyses adjusting for highly prognostic baseline characteristics, the HRs were 0.89 (95\% Cl, 0.81-0.99; P=.03) for all-cause mortality or hospitalization, 0.91 (95\% Cl, 0.82-1.01; P=.O9) for cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, and 0.85 (95\% Cl, 0.74-0.99; P= .03) for cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization. Other adverse events were similar between the groups. Conclusions In the protocol-specified primary analysis, exercise training resulted in nonsignificant reductions in the primary end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization and in key secondary clinical end points. After adjustment for highly prognostic predictors of the primary end point, exercise training was associated with modest significant reductions for both all-cause mortality or hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization. {\copyright} 2009 American Medical Association.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) has been hypothesized to be involved in atherogenesis through pathways related to inflammation. Darapladib is an oral, selective inhibitor of the Lp-PLA2 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of darapladib in patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: SOLID-TIMI 52 was a multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 13,026 participants within 30 days of hospitalization with an ACS (non-ST-elevation or ST-elevation myocardial infarction [MI]) at 868 sites in 36 countries. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to either once-daily darapladib (160 mg) or placebo on a background of guideline-recommended therapy. Patients were followed up for a median of 2.5 years between December 7, 2009, and December 6, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point (major coronary events) was the composite of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, MI, or urgent coronary revascularization for myocardial ischemia. Kaplan-Meier event rates are reported at 3 years. RESULTS: During a median duration of 2.5 years, the primary end point occurred in 903 patients in the darapladib group and 910 in the placebo group (16.3\% vs 15.6\% at 3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.00 [95\% CI, 0.91-1.09]; P\,=\,.93). The composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke occurred in 824 in the darapladib group and 838 in the placebo group (15.0\% vs 15.0\% at 3 years; HR, 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.90-1.09]; P\,=\,.78). There were no differences between the treatment groups for additional secondary end points, for individual components of the primary end point, or in all-cause mortality (371 events in the darapladib group and 395 in the placebo group [7.3\% vs 7.1\% at 3 years; HR, 0.94 [95\% CI, 0.82-1.08]; P\,=\,.40). Patients were more likely to report an odor-related concern in the darapladib group vs the placebo group (11.5\% vs 2.5\%) and also more likely to report diarrhea (10.6\% vs 5.6\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients who experienced an ACS event, direct inhibition of Lp-PLA2 with darapladib added to optimal medical therapy and initiated within 30 days of hospitalization did not reduce the risk of major coronary events.

Overall, HF risk was more strongly associated with central adiposity (waist circumference (WC) adjusted for body mass index (BMI); HR 1.38, 95\% CI 1.32 to 1.45) than general adiposity (BMI adjusted for WC; HR 1.22, 95\% CI 1.16 to 1.27). Although dual X-ray absorptiometry-derived body fat remained positively related to HF after adjustment for fat-free mass (HR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.59), the association of fat-free mass with HF was substantially attenuated by fat mass (HR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.26) while visceral fat (VAT) remained associated with HF independent of subcutaneous fat (HR 1.20, 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.33). In analyses of HF subtypes, HF with preserved ejection fraction was independently associated with all fat measures (eg, VAT: HR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.35; body fat: HR 1.36, 95\% CI 1.17 to 1.57) while HF with reduced ejection fraction was not independently associated with fat measures (eg, VAT: HR 1.29, 95\% CI 0.98 to 1.68; body fat: HR 1.29, 95\% CI 0.80 to 2.07).Conclusions This large-scale study shows that excess adiposity and fat mass are associated with higher HF risk while the association of fat-free mass with HF could be explained largely by its correlation with fat mass.

Subjective well-being, a phenotype that is genetically correlated with both of these traits, has not yet been studied with genome-wide data. We conducted genome-wide association studies of three phenotypes: subjective well-being (n = 298,420), depressive symptoms (n = 161,460), and neuroticism (n = 170,911). We identify 3 variants associated with subjective well-being, 2 variants associated with depressive symptoms, and 11 variants associated with neuroticism, including 2 inversion polymorphisms. The two loci associated with depressive symptoms replicate in an independent depression sample. Joint analyses that exploit the high genetic correlations between the phenotypes ({\textbar}{$\rho$}{\textasciicircum}{\textbar} {$\approx$} 0.8) strengthen the overall credibility of the findings and allow us to identify additional variants. Across our phenotypes, loci regulating expression in central nervous system and adrenal or pancreas tissues are strongly enriched for association.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that assessed the performance of body mass index (BMI) to detect body adiposity. DESIGN: Data sources were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. To be included, studies must have assessed the performance of BMI to measure body adiposity, provided standard values of diagnostic performance, and used a body composition technique as the reference standard for body fat percent (BF\%) measurement. We obtained pooled summary statistics for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). The inconsistency statistic (I2) assessed potential heterogeneity. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 3341 potentially relevant abstracts, and 25 articles met our predefined inclusion criteria. These studies evaluated 32 different samples totaling 31 968 patients. Commonly used BMI cutoffs to diagnose obesity showed a pooled sensitivity to detect high adiposity of 0.50 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.43-0.57) and a pooled specificity of 0.90 (CI: 0.86-0.94). Positive LR was 5.88 (CI: 4.24-8.15), I (2)=97.8\%; the negative LR was 0.43 (CI: 0.37-0.50), I (2)=98.5\%; and the DOR was 17.91 (CI: 12.56-25.53), I (2)=91.7\%. Analysis of studies that used BMI cutoffs {$>$}or=30 had a pooled sensitivity of 0.42 (CI: 0.31-0.43) and a pooled specificity of 0.97 (CI: 0.96-0.97). Cutoff values and regional origin of the studies can only partially explain the heterogeneity seen in pooled DOR estimates. CONCLUSION: Commonly used BMI cutoff values to diagnose obesity have high specificity, but low sensitivity to identify adiposity, as they fail to identify half of the people with excess BF\%.},

  abstract = {AIMS: An excessive production of aldosterone influences outcome in patients with heart failure (HF) and in obese patients. Findings from laboratory studies suggest that chronic aldosterone blockade maybe more beneficial in abdominally obese HF-prone rats. In the current study, we investigated if the clinical response to a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in mildly symptomatic HF patients varied by abdominal obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2587 NYHA class II, reduced ejection fraction HF (HFrEF) patients enrolled in the EMPHASIS-HF trial were randomly assigned to eplerenone and placebo. In this post hoc analysis, patients were categorized according to waist circumference (WC) (normal if WC {$<$} 102\,cm in men and\,{$<$}\,88\,cm in women; abdominal obesity if WC {$\geq$} 102\,cm in men and\,{$\geq$}\,88\,cm women). The potential statistical interaction between the treatment and WC was assessed on the primary endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for HF and other secondary endpoints. Over a median follow-up of 21 months, a significant benefit of eplerenone for the primary outcome was noted in both normal [hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.98, P = 0.03] and increased (HR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.37-0.63, P {$<$} 0.0001) WC subgroups, but the latter patients appeared to receive greater benefit than patients with normal WC (P for interaction = 0.01). This suggests a significant quantitative (treatment effect varies in magnitude by subgroup, but is always in same direction) rather than a qualitative interaction (direction of the treatment effect varies by subgroup) between eplerenone and WC in the adjusted analysis. Mean doses of eplerenone, blood pressure and serum potassium changes and adverse events were similar between WC subgroups. CONCLUSION: In EMPHASIS-HF, eplerenone improved outcomes in HFrEF patients with and without abdominal obesity, although the benefit appeared to be more pronounced among those with abdominal obesity. The findings are potentially hypothesis generating and need to be replicated in other HFrEF populations.},

One direct and powerful way to assess the genetic causality behind GWAS is through analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Here we describe a new approach to estimate the tissues behind the genetic causality of a variety of GWAS traits, using the cis-eQTLs in 44 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium. We have adapted the regulatory trait concordance (RTC) score to measure the probability of eQTLs being active in multiple tissues and to calculate the probability that a GWAS-associated variant and an eQTL tag the same functional effect. By normalizing the GWAS-eQTL probabilities by the tissue-sharing estimates for eQTLs, we generate relative tissue-causality profiles for GWAS traits. Our approach not only implicates the gene likely mediating individual GWAS signals, but also highlights tissues where the genetic causality for an individual trait is likely manifested.},

  abstract = {Children with obesity typically have larger left ventricular heart dimensions during adulthood. However, whether this is due to a persistent effect of adiposity extending into adulthood is challenging to disentangle due to confounding factors throughout the lifecourse. We conducted a multivariable mendelian randomization (MR) study to separate the independent effects of childhood and adult body size on 4 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of heart structure and function in the UK Biobank (UKB) study. Strong evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on all measures of adulthood heart structure was identified, which remained robust upon accounting for adult body size using a multivariable MR framework (e.g., left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), Beta = 0.33, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23 to 0.43, P = 4.6 {\texttimes} 10-10). Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that other lifecourse measures of body composition were responsible for these effects. Conversely, evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on various other MRI-based measures, such as fat percentage in the liver (Beta = 0.14, 95\% CI = 0.05 to 0.23, P = 0.002) and pancreas (Beta = 0.21, 95\% CI = 0.10 to 0.33, P = 3.9 {\texttimes} 10-4), attenuated upon accounting for adult body size. Our findings suggest that childhood body size has a long-term (and potentially immutable) influence on heart structure in later life. In contrast, effects of childhood body size on other measures of adulthood organ size and fat percentage evaluated in this study are likely explained by the long-term consequence of remaining overweight throughout the lifecourse., Children with obesity typically have larger left ventricular heart dimensions during adulthood, but this is challenging to disentangle due to confounding factors throughout life. This study uses Mendelian randomization to provide evidence that being overweight in early life may indeed have a long-term influence on cardiac structure.},

Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 140 patients with CHF. Age-adjusted Pearson correlations between each index and measures of body composition for men and women were calculated. Diagnostic accuracy of detecting obesity or high central fat was also examined. In men, all of the anthropometric indices except waist index were just as strongly correlated with lean body mass (correlation coefficients varied between 0.56 for waist-stature ratio to 0.74 for BMI) as with percentage of body fat (correlation coefficients varied between 0.72 for BMI to 0.79 for waist circumference). In women, all 4 anthropometric measures were unable to significantly differentiate between body fat and lean body mass. The positive likelihood ratios for the detection of obesity varied between 2.26 for waist circumference and 3.42 for BMI, waist-stature ratio, and waist index. Anthropometric indices do not accurately reflect body composition in patients with CHF, especially in women. When accurate assessment of body composition is required, direct measurements should be obtained.},

  abstract = {Epicardial adipose tissue has unique properties that distinguish it from other depots of visceral fat. Rather than having distinct boundaries, the epicardium shares an unobstructed microcirculation with the underlying myocardium, and in healthy conditions, produces cytokines that nourish the heart. However, in chronic inflammatory disorders (especially those leading to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), the epicardium becomes a site of deranged adipogenesis, leading to the secretion of proinflammatory adipokines that can cause atrial and ventricular fibrosis. Accordingly, in patients at risk of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, drugs that promote the accumulation or inflammation of epicardial adipocytes may lead to heart failure, whereas treatments that ameliorate the proinflammatory characteristics of epicardial fat may reduce the risk of heart failure. These observations suggest that epicardial adipose tissue is a transducer of the adverse effects of systemic inflammation and metabolic disorders on the heart, and thus, represents an important target for therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity increases the risk of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Tirzepatide, a long-acting agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors, causes considerable weight loss, but data are lacking with respect to its effects on cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS: In this international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 731 patients with heart failure, an ejection fraction of at least 50\%, and a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of at least 30 to receive tirzepatide (up to 15 mg subcutaneously once per week) or placebo for at least 52 weeks. The two primary end points were a composite of adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes or a worsening heart-failure event (assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis) and the change from baseline to 52 weeks in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life). RESULTS: A total of 364 patients were assigned to the tirzepatide group and 367 to the placebo group; the median duration of follow-up was 104 weeks. Adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes or a worsening heart-failure event occurred in 36 patients (9.9\%) in the tirzepatide group and in 56 patients (15.3\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.95; P\,=\,0.026). Worsening heart-failure events occurred in 29 patients (8.0\%) in the tirzepatide group and in 52 patients (14.2\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.34 to 0.85), and adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 8 patients (2.2\%) and 5 patients (1.4\%), respectively (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 4.83). At 52 weeks, the mean ({\textpm}SD) change in the KCCQ-CSS was 19.5{\textpm}1.2 in the tirzepatide group as compared with 12.7{\textpm}1.3 in the placebo group (between-group difference, 6.9; 95\% CI, 3.3 to 10.6; P{$<$}0.001). Adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) leading to discontinuation of the trial drug occurred in 23 patients (6.3\%) in the tirzepatide group and in 5 patients (1.4\%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tirzepatide led to a lower risk of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or worsening heart failure than placebo and improved health status in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sub-analysis of the MAGGIC meta-analysis of patient-level data from 14 HF studies was performed.

Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, aetiology (ischaemic or non-ischaemic), hypertension, diabetes and baseline blood pressure, stratified by study, were used to examine the independent association between BMI and 3-year total mortality.

  abstract = {Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with higher risk for heart failure (HF). The impact of a lifestyle intervention and changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and body mass index (BMI) on risk for HF is not well-established. Methods: Participants from the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial without prevalent HF were included. Time to event analyses were used to compare the risk of incident HF between the intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) vs. diabetes support and education (DSE) groups. The associations of baseline measures of CRF estimated from a maximal treadmill test, BMI, and longitudinal changes in these parameters with risk of HF were evaluated using multivariable adjusted Cox models. Results: Among the 5,109 trial participants, there was no significant difference in the risk of incident HF (n = 257) between the ILI vs. DSE groups [HR (95\% CI) = 0.96 (0.75 to 1.23)] over a median follow-up of 12.4 years. In the most adjusted Cox models, the risk of HF was 39\% and 62\% lower among moderate fit [Tertile 2: HR (95\% CI) = 0.61 (0.44 to 0.83)] and high fit [Tertile 3: HR (95\% CI) = 0.38 (0.24 to 0.59)] groups, respectively (referent group: low fit, Tertile 1). Among HF subtypes, after adjustment for traditional CV risk factors and interval incidence of MI, baseline CRF was not significantly associated with risk of incident HFrEF. In contrast, the risk of incident HFpEF was 40\% lower in moderate fit and 77\% lower in the high fit groups. Baseline BMI was also not associated with risk of incident HF, HFpEF, or HFrEF after adjustment for CRF and traditional CV risk factors. Among participants with repeat CRF assessments (n = 3,902), improvements in CRF and weight loss over 4-year follow-up was significantly associated with lower risk of HF [HR (95\% CI) per 10\% increase in CRF = 0.90 (0.82 to 0.99), per 10\% decrease in BMI = 0.80 (0.69 to 0.94)]. Conclusions: Among participants with T2DM in the Look AHEAD trial, the ILI did not appear to modify the risk of HF. Higher baseline CRF and sustained improvements in CRF and weight loss were associated with lower risk of HF.},

However, it is unclear if this relationship is consistent for both heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). OBJECTIVES: This study sought to quantify dose-response associations between LTPA, BMI, and the risk of different HF subtypes. METHODS: Individual-level data from 3 cohort studies (WHI [Women's Health Initiative], MESA [Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis], and CHS [Cardiovascular Health Study]) were pooled and participants were stratified into guideline-recommended categories of LTPA and BMI. Associations between LTPA, BMI, and risk of overall HF, HFpEF (ejection fraction~{$\geq$}45\%), and HFrEF (ejection fraction~{$<$}45\%) were assessed by using multivariable adjusted Cox models and restricted cubic splines. RESULTS: The study included 51,451 participants with 3,180 HF events (1,252 HFpEF, 914 HFrEF, and 1,014 unclassified HF). In the adjusted analysis, there was a dose-dependent association between higher LTPA levels, lower BMI, and overall~HF risk. Among HF subtypes, LTPA in any dose range was not associated with HFrEF risk. In contrast, lower levels of LTPA ({$<$}500 MET-min/week) were not associated with HFpEF risk, and dose-dependent associations with lower HFpEF risk were observed at higher levels. Compared with no LTPA, higher than twice the guideline-recommended minimum LTPA levels ({$>$}1,000 MET-min/week) were associated with an 19\% lower risk of HFpEF (hazard ratio: 0.81; 95\% confidence interval: 0.68 to 0.97). The dose-response relationship for BMI with HFpEF risk was also more consistent than with HFrEF risk, such that increasing BMI above the normal range ({$\geq$}25 kg/m2) was associated with a greater increase in risk of HFpEF than HFrEF.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of an AI algorithm in diagnosing near-total or total occlusion of coronary arteries in OHCA patients who regained spontaneous circulation. Conducted from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2022 at a tertiary university hospital emergency department, it involved 82 OHCA patients, with 58 qualifying after exclusions. The AI used was the Quantitative ECG (QCG™) system, which provides a STEMI diagnostic score ranging from 0 to 100. The QCG score's diagnostic performance was compared to assessments by two emergency physicians and three cardiologists. Among the patients, coronary occlusion was identified in 24. The QCG score showed a significant difference between occlusion and non-occlusion groups, with the former scoring higher. The QCG biomarker had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.770, outperforming the expert group's AUC of 0.676. It demonstrated 70.8\% sensitivity and 79.4\% specificity. These findings suggest that the AI-based ECG biomarker could predict coronary occlusion in resuscitated OHCA patients, and it was non-inferior to the consensus of the expert group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intentional weight loss is associated with lower risk of heart failure (HF) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease among patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the contribution of baseline measures and longitudinal changes in fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), and waist circumference (WC) to the risk of HF and myocardial infarction (MI) in type 2 diabetes is not well established. METHODS: Adults from the Look AHEAD trial (Action for Health in Diabetes) without prevalent HF were included. FM and LM were predicted using validated equations and compared with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements in a subgroup. Adjusted Cox models were used to evaluate the associations of baseline and longitudinal changes in FM, LM, and WC over 1- and 4-year follow-up with risk of overall HF, HF with preserved ejection fraction (EF; EF {$\geq$}50\%), HF with reduced EF (EF {$<$}50\%), and MI. RESULTS: Among 5103 participants, there were 257 incident HF events over 12.4 years of follow-up. Predicted and measured FM/LM were highly correlated (R2=0.87-0.90; n=1369). FM and LM decreased over 4-year follow-up with greater declines in the intensive lifestyle intervention arm. In adjusted analysis, baseline body composition measures were not significantly associated with HF risk. Decline in FM and WC, but not LM, over 1 year were each significantly associated with lower risk of overall HF (adjusted hazard ratio per 10\% decrease in FM, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.68-0.95]; adjusted hazard ratio per 10\% decrease in WC, 0.77 [95\% CI, 0.62-0.95]). Decline in FM was significantly associated with lower risk of both HF subtypes. In contrast, decline in WC was significantly associated with lower risk of HF with preserved EF but not HF with reduced EF. Similar patterns of association were observed for 4-year changes in body composition and HF risk. Longitudinal changes in body composition were not significantly associated with risk of MI. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with type 2 diabetes, a lifestyle intervention is associated with significant loss of FM and LM. Declines in FM and WC, but not LM, were each significantly associated with lower risk of HF but not MI. Furthermore, decline in WC was significantly associated with lower risk of HF with preserved EF but not HF with reduced EF.

In this manuscript, we describe functions that have been added or edited in the package since version 0.5.0, when we last described the package and its contents. The main additions to the package since that time are: 1) new robust methods for performing Mendelian randomization, particularly in the cases of bias from weak instruments and/or winner's curse, and pleiotropic variants, 2) methods for performing Mendelian randomization with correlated variants using dimension reduction to summarize large numbers of highly correlated variants into a limited set of principal components, 3) functions for calculating first-stage F statistics, representing instrument strength, in both univariable and multivariable contexts, and with uncorrelated and correlated genetic variants. We also discuss some pragmatic issues relating to the use of correlated variants in Mendelian randomization.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity at genomic loci encoding drug targets can be exploited by multivariable Mendelian randomization to provide insight on the pathways by which pharmacological interventions may affect disease risk. However, statistical inference in such investigations may be poor if overdispersion heterogeneity in measured genetic associations is unaccounted for. In this work, we first develop conditional F-statistics for dimension-reduced genetic associations that enable more accurate measurement of phenotypic heterogeneity. We then develop a novel extension for two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization that accounts for overdispersion heterogeneity in dimension-reduced genetic associations. Our empirical focus is to use genetic variants in the GLP1R gene region to understand the mechanism by which GLP1R agonism affects coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Colocalization analyses indicate that distinct variants in the GLP1R gene region are associated with body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses that were corrected for overdispersion heterogeneity suggest that bodyweight lowering rather than type 2 diabetes liability lowering effects of GLP1R agonism are more likely contributing to reduced CAD risk. Tissue-specific analyses prioritised brain tissue as the most likely to be relevant for CAD risk, of the tissues considered. We hope the multivariable Mendelian randomization approach illustrated here is widely applicable to better understand mechanisms linking drug targets to diseases outcomes, and hence to guide drug development efforts.},

  abstract = {Context: Evidence suggests that more intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) than is commonly applied clinically will provide further benefit in stable coronary artery disease. Objective: To compare the effects of 2 strategies of lipid lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI). Design, Setting, and Participants: The IDEAL study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial conducted at 190 ambulatory cardiology care and specialist practices in northern Europe between March 1999 and March 2005 with a median follow-up of 4.8 years, which enrolled 8888 patients aged 80 years or younger with a history of acute MI. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/d; n=4439), or usual-dose simvastatin (20 mg/d; n=4449). Main Outcome Measure: Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. Results: During treatment, mean LDL-C levels were 104 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 81 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the atorvastatin group. A major coronary event occurred in 463 simvastatin patients (10.4\%) and in 411 atorvastatin patients (9.3\%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.78-1.01; P=.07). Nonfatal acute MI occurred in 321 (7.2\%) and 267 (6.0\%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.98; P=.02), but no differences were seen in the 2 other components of the primary end point. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 608 and 533 in the 2 groups, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.77-0.98; P=.02). Occurrence of any coronary event was reported in 1059 simvastatin and 898 atorvastatin patients (HR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.76-0.91; P{\textexclamdown}.001). Noncardiovascular death occurred in 156 (3.5\%) and 143 (3.2\%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.73-1.15; P=.47). Death from any cause occurred in 374 (8.4\%) in the simvastatin group and 366 (8.2\%) in the atorvastatin group (HR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.13; P=.81). Patients in the atorvastatin group had higher rates of drug discontinuation due to nonserious adverse events; transaminase elevation resulted in 43 (1.0\%) vs 5 (0.1\%) withdrawals (P{\textexclamdown}.001). Serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were rare in both groups. Conclusions: In this study of patients with previous MI, intensive lowering of LDL-C did not result in a significant reduction in the primary outcome of major coronary events, but did reduce the risk of other composite secondary end points and nonfatal acute MI. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Patients with MI may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL-C without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3319 patients) or placebo (3313 patients) [correction] in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1012 deaths occurred. The primary end points were death from any cause and death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia. RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; P=0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; P=0.005). The rate of the other primary end point, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; P=0.002), as was the secondary end point of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; P=0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; P=0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (P=0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (P{\textexclamdown}0.001).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sustained sympathetic activation contributes to the progression of myocardial cell injury, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in heart failure (HF). OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effects of radiofrequency renal nerve denervation (RF-RDN) on the pathobiology of HF and the interaction between the renal sympathetic nerves and natriuretic peptide (NP) metabolism. METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were subjected to 45~min of coronary artery ligation and reperfusion for 12~weeks. At 4~weeks post-reperfusion, SHR and WKY underwent either bilateral RF-RDN or sham-RDN. RESULTS: Following RF-RDN in both strains, LV ejection fraction remained significantly above those levels in respective sham-RDN rats, and at the end of the 12-week study, rats in both strains had significantly reduced LV fibrosis and improved vascular function. RF-RDN therapy significantly improved vascular reactivity to endothelium-dependent and~-independent vasodilators as well as vascular compliance in the setting of severe HF. Improvements in LV function were accompanied by significant elevations in circulating NP as compared to those associated with sham-RDN. Further investigation into the cause of increased circulating NP levels demonstrated that RF-RDN significantly inhibited renal neprilysin activity in SHR and WKY with HF. Likewise, chronic treatment with the beta1 antagonist bisoprolol inhibited renal neprilysin activity and increased circulation NP levels in WKY with HF. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a novel endogenous pathway by which the renal nerves participate in the degradation of cardioprotective NP. Furthermore, removal of the influence of the renal nerves on kidney function attenuates renal neprilysin activity, augments circulating NP levels, reduces myocardial fibrosis, and improves LV function in the setting of HF.},

Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs, indicating their potential involvement in regulation of gene expression. Here, we propose a transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously. Applied to 43 human phenotypes, it uncovers 3,913 putatively causal gene--trait associations, 36\% of which have no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS. Using independent association summary statistics, we find that the majority of these loci were missed by GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a Mendelian form of encephalopathy. We also find pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections. TWMR better accounts for pleiotropy and has the potential to identify biological mechanisms underlying complex traits.},

  abstract = {Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The known determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy only partially explain its variability. The purpose of this study was to estimate heritability of left ventricular mass. The study sample included adults in the original Framingham Heart Study and the Framingham Offspring Study who were not receiving antihypertensive medications and who were free of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, valvular heart disease, and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass among first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, and unrelated spouse pairs were calculated to determine the contribution of heredity to the variability in left ventricular mass. After adjustments for age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure, the intraclass correlations between first-degree relatives were .15 (parent-child, P{$<$}.001) to .16 (siblings, P{$<$}.001), between second-degree relatives the correlation was .06 (P=NS), and between spouses it was .05 (P=NS). The estimated heritability of adjusted left ventricular mass was between .24 and .32. The proportion of the variance in sex-specific left ventricular mass explained by age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure was .26 in men and .34 in women. On the basis of intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass, incorporation of adjusted left ventricular mass of a parent or sibling would increase the explained variance by an additional .02 to .03. Heredity explains a small, but discernible proportion of the variance in left ventricular mass. Studies are currently under way to identify genetic markers that predict an individual's predisposition to left ventricular hypertrophy. This knowledge may lead to advances in the prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

Whether the obesity-related survival benefit generally observed in HFpEF extends to individuals with concomitant T2DM is unclear. This study sought to examine the prognostic role of overweight and obesity in a large cohort of HFpEF with and without T2DM.This large-scale cohort study included patients with HFpEF enrolled between 2010 and 2020. The relationship between body mass index (BMI), T2DM, and survival was assessed. A total of 6744 individuals with HFpEF were included, of which 1702 (25\%) had T2DM. Patients with T2DM had higher BMI values (29.4 kg/m2 vs. 27.1 kg/m2, P \&lt; 0.001), higher N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide values (864 mg/dL vs. 724 mg/dL, P \&lt; 0.001), and a higher prevalence of numerous risk factors/comorbidities than those without T2DM. During a median follow-up time of 47 months (Q1--Q3: 20--80), 2014 (30\%) patients died. Patients with T2DM had a higher incidence of fatal events compared with those without T2DM, with a mortality rate of 39.2\% and 26.7\%, respectively (P \&lt; 0.001). In the overall cohort, using the BMI category 22.5--24.9 kg/m2 as the reference group, the unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause death was increased in patients with BMI \&lt;22.5 kg/m2 [HR: 1.27 (confidence interval 1.09--1.48), P = 0.003] and decreased in BMI categories {$\geq$}25 kg/m2. After multivariate adjustment, BMI remained significantly inversely associated with survival in non-T2DM, whereas survival was unaltered at a wide range of BMI in patients with T2DM.Among the various phenotypes of HFpEF, the T2DM phenotype is specifically associated with a greater disease burden. Higher BMI is linked to improved survival in HFpEF overall, while this effect neutralises in patients with concomitant T2DM. Advising BMI--based weight targets and weight loss may be pursued with different intensity in the management of HFpEF, particularly in the presence of T2DM.Individuals with HFpEF and concomitant diabetes show a distinct phenotype particularly associated with a higher disease burden and worse outcome. The obesity paradox observed in individuals with heart failure may not be generalized to HFpEF patients with concomitant diabetes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main associations of body-mass index (BMI) with overall and cause-specific mortality can best be assessed by long-term prospective follow-up of large numbers of people. The Prospective Studies Collaboration aimed to investigate these associations by sharing data from many studies. METHODS: Collaborative analyses were undertaken of baseline BMI versus mortality in 57 prospective studies with 894 576 participants, mostly in western Europe and North America (61\% [n=541 452] male, mean recruitment age 46 [SD 11] years, median recruitment year 1979 [IQR 1975-85], mean BMI 25 [SD 4] kg/m(2)). The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and study. To limit reverse causality, the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded, leaving 66 552 deaths of known cause during a mean of 8 (SD 6) further years of follow-up (mean age at death 67 [SD 10] years): 30 416 vascular; 2070 diabetic, renal or hepatic; 22 592 neoplastic; 3770 respiratory; 7704 other. FINDINGS: In both sexes, mortality was lowest at about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). Above this range, positive associations were recorded for several specific causes and inverse associations for none, the absolute excess risks for higher BMI and smoking were roughly additive, and each 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI was on average associated with about 30\% higher overall mortality (hazard ratio per 5 kg/m(2) [HR] 1.29 [95\% CI 1.27-1.32]): 40\% for vascular mortality (HR 1.41 [1.37-1.45]); 60-120\% for diabetic, renal, and hepatic mortality (HRs 2.16 [1.89-2.46], 1.59 [1.27-1.99], and 1.82 [1.59-2.09], respectively); 10\% for neoplastic mortality (HR 1.10 [1.06-1.15]); and 20\% for respiratory and for all other mortality (HRs 1.20 [1.07-1.34] and 1.20 [1.16-1.25], respectively). Below the range 22.5-25 kg/m(2), BMI was associated inversely with overall mortality, mainly because of strong inverse associations with respiratory disease and lung cancer. These inverse associations were much stronger for smokers than for non-smokers, despite cigarette consumption per smoker varying little with BMI. INTERPRETATION: Although other anthropometric measures (eg, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) could well add extra information to BMI, and BMI to them, BMI is in itself a strong predictor of overall mortality both above and below the apparent optimum of about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). The progressive excess mortality above this range is due mainly to vascular disease and is probably largely causal. At 30-35 kg/m(2), median survival is reduced by 2-4 years; at 40-45 kg/m(2), it is reduced by 8-10 years (which is comparable with the effects of smoking). The definite excess mortality below 22.5 kg/m(2) is due mainly to smoking-related diseases, and is not fully explained.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

Applying THISTLE together with a complementary sQTL mapping strategy to brain transcriptomic (n\,=\,2,865) and genotype data, we identified 12,794 genes with cis-sQTLs at P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8, approximately 61\% of which were distinct from eQTLs. Integrating the sQTL data into GWAS for 12 brain-related complex traits (including diseases), we identified 244 genes associated with the traits through cis-sQTLs, approximately 61\% of which could not be discovered using the corresponding eQTL data. Our study demonstrates the distinct role of most sQTLs in the genetic regulation of transcription and complex trait variation.},

  abstract = {Understanding the difference in genetic regulation of gene expression between brain and blood is important for discovering genes for brain-related traits and disorders. Here, we estimate the correlation of genetic effects at the top-associated cis-expression or -DNA methylation (DNAm) quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs or cis-mQTLs) between brain and blood (rb). Using publicly available data, we find that genetic effects at the top cis-eQTLs or mQTLs are highly correlated between independent brain and blood samples (\$\${\textbackslash}hat r\_b = 0.70\$\$for cis-eQTLs and \$\${\textbackslash}hat r\_ b = 0.78\$\$for cis-mQTLs). Using meta-analyzed brain cis-eQTL/mQTL data (n =\,526~to~1194), we identify 61 genes and 167 DNAm sites associated with four brain-related phenotypes, most of which are a subset of the discoveries (97 genes and 295 DNAm sites) using data from blood with larger sample sizes (n\,=\,1980~to~14,115). Our results demonstrate the gain of power in gene discovery for brain-related phenotypes using blood cis-eQTL/mQTL data with large sample sizes.},

  abstract = {One of the major manifestations of obesity is increased production of the adipocyte-derived 16-kDa peptide leptin, which is also elevated in heart disease, including congestive heart failure. However, whether leptin can directly alter the cardiac phenotype is not known. We therefore studied the effect of leptin as a potential hypertrophic factor in cultured myocytes from 1- to 4-day-old neonatal rat heart ventricles. Using RT-PCR, we demonstrate that these cells express the short-form (OB-Ra) leptin receptor. Twenty-four hours of exposure to leptin (0.31 to 31.3 nmol/L) produces a significantly increased cell surface area that peaked at 0.63 nmol/L. Subsequent experiments were done with 3.1 nmol/L leptin, which significantly increased cell area by 42\%, protein synthesis by 32\%, and {$\alpha$}-skeletal actin and myosin light chain-2 expression by 250\% and 300\%, respectively. These events occurred in the absence of any increased cell death. Hypertrophy was preceded by rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase system including p38 and p44/42 as early as 5 minutes after leptin addition, whereas hypertrophy was inhibited by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 but not by the p44/42 inhibitor PD98059. Our results demonstrate a direct hypertrophic effect of leptin and may offer a biological link between hypertrophy and hyperleptinemic conditions such as obesity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare various measures of adiposity with risk for incident hospitalized heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for HF, particularly HFpEF. It is unknown which measures of adiposity, including anthropometrics and computed tomography (CT)-measured fat area, are most predictive of HF subtypes. METHODS: The authors studied 1,806 participants of the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study without baseline cardiovascular disease who underwent anthropometrics (body mass index [BMI] and waist circumference) and an abdominal CT. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were measured from a single CT slice at L2-L3. Cox hazard models were used to examine associations of adiposity with incident hospitalized HFpEF and HFrEF events. Fully adjusted models included demographics, HF risk factors, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 11 years, there were 34 HFpEF and 36 HFrEF events. The fully adjusted hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval [CI]) per 1-SD higher of each anthropometric and CT-measured adiposity measures for incident HFpEF were as follows: BMI HR: 1.66; 95\% CI: 1.12 to 2.45; waist circumference HR: 1.59; 95\% CI: 1.05 to 2.40; and VAT HR: 2.24; 95\% CI: 1.44 to 3.49. None of these adiposity measures were associated with HFrEF. Even among overweight/obese adults (BMI~{$\geq$}25 kg/m2), assessment of VAT (per 1-SD) was strongly associated with HFpEF (HR: 2.78; 95\% CI: 1.62 to 4.76). Subcutaneous adipose tissue was neither associated with HFpEF nor HFrEF. CONCLUSIONS: In a multiethnic cohort free of cardiovascular disease, CT-measured VAT was independently associated~with incident hospitalized HFpEF but not HFrEF. Measuring visceral fat at the time of CT imaging for other~indications may offer additional prognostication of HF risk. (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [MESA]; NCT00005487).},

We assessed the effectiveness of lowering blood pressure in preventing recurrent vascular events in patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: We performed a systematic review and meta-regression of completed randomized controlled trials that investigated the effect of lowering blood pressure on recurrent vascular events in patients with prior ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Trials were identified from searches of 3 electronic databases (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE). Seven randomized controlled trials, with 8 comparison groups, were included. Lowering blood pressure or treating hypertension with a variety of antihypertensive agents reduced stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.63 to 0.92), nonfatal stroke (OR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.65 to 0.95), myocardial infarction (OR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.63 to 0.98), and total vascular events (OR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 0.95). No effect was seen on vascular or all-cause mortality. Heterogeneity was present for several outcomes and was partly related to the class of antihypertensive drugs used; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics separately, and especially together, reduced vascular events, while beta-receptor antagonists had no discernable effect. The reduction in stroke was related to the difference in systolic blood pressure between treatment and control groups (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from randomized controlled trials supports the use of antihypertensive agents in lowering blood pressure for the prevention of vascular events in patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Vascular prevention is associated positively with the magnitude by which blood pressure is reduced.},

We identified 70 HFrEF and 10 HFpEF gene-hits, of which 58 are novel. In 14 known loci for unclassified HF, we identified HFrEF as the subtype responsible for the signal. HFrEF hits ZBTB17, MTSS1, PDLIM5, and MLIP and novel HFpEF hits NFATC2IP, and PABPC4 showed robustness to MR assumptions, support from orthogonal sources, compelling evidence on mechanism of action needed for therapeutic efficacy, and no evidence of an unacceptable safety profile. We strengthen the value of pathways such as ubiquitin-proteasome system, small ubiquitin-related modifier pathway, inflammation, and mitochondrial metabolism as potential therapeutic targets for HF management. We identified IL6R, ADM, and EDNRA as suggestive hits for HFrEF and LPA for HFrEF and HFpEF, which enhances the odds of success for existing cardiovascular investigational drugs targeting. These findings confirm the unique value of human genetic studies in HFrEF and HFpEF for discovery of novel targets and generation of therapeutic target profiles needed to initiate new validation programs in HFrEF and HFpEF preclinical models.},

  abstract = {Approximately half of patients with heart failure have preserved ejection fraction. There is no proven treatment that improves outcome. The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is complex and includes left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary vascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, and peripheral abnormalities. Multiple lines of evidence point to impaired nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP bioavailability as playing a central role in each of these abnormalities. In contrast to traditional organic nitrate therapies, an alternative strategy to restore NO-cGMP signaling is via inorganic nitrite. Inorganic nitrite, previously considered to be an inert byproduct of NO metabolism, functions as an important in vivo reservoir for NO generation, particularly under hypoxic and acidosis conditions. As such, inorganic nitrite becomes most active at times of greater need for NO signaling, as during exercise when left ventricular filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures increase. Herein, we present the rationale and design for the INDIE-HFpEF trial (Inorganic Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction), which is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study assessing the effect of inhaled inorganic nitrite on peak exercise capacity, conducted in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored Heart Failure Clinical Research Network.

  abstract = {Importance: Studies in experimental and human heart failure suggest that phos-phodiesterase-5 inhibitors may enhance cardiovascular function and thus exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). Objective: To determine the effect of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with placebo on exercise capacity and clinical status in HFPEF. Design: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 216 stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction {$\geq$}50\%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity. Participants were randomized from October 2008 through February 2012 at 26 centers in North America. Follow-up was through August 30, 2012. Interventions: Sildenafil (n=113) or placebo (n=103) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Primary end point was change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included change in 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite clinical status score (range, 1-n, a higher value indicates better status; expected value with no treatment effect, 95) based on time to death, time to cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization, and change in quality of life for participants without cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization at 24 weeks. Results: Median age was 69 years, and 48\% of patients were women. At baseline, median peak oxygen consumption (11.7 mL/kg/min) and 6-minute walk distance (308 m) were reduced. The median E/e{$\prime$} (16), left atrial volume index (44 mL/m2), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (41 mm Hg) were consistent with chronically elevated left ventricular filling pressures. At 24 weeks, median (IQR) changes in peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) in patients who received placebo (-0.20 [IQR, -0.70 to 1.00]) or sildenafil (-0.20 [IQR, -1.70 to 1.11]) were not significantly different (P=.90) in analyses in which patients with missing week-24 data were excluded, and in sensitivity analysis based on intention to treat with multiple imputation for missing values (mean between-group difference, 0.01 mL/kg/min, [95\% CI, -0.60 to 0.61]). The mean clinical status rank score was not significantly different at 24 weeks between placebo (95.8) and sildenafil (94.2) (P=.85). Changes in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks in patients who received placebo (15.0 m [IQR, -26.0 to 45.0]) or sildenafil (5.0 m [IQR, -37.0 to 55.0]; P=.92) were also not significantly different. Adverse events occurred in 78 placebo patients (76\%) and 90 sildenafil patients (80\%). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 placebo patients (16\%) and 25 sildenafil patients (22\%). Conclusion and Relevance: Among patients with HFPEF, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with administration of sildenafil for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity or clinical status.

BACKGROUND Nitrates are commonly prescribed to enhance activity tolerance in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction. We compared the effect of isosorbide mononitrate or placebo on daily activity in such patients. METHODS In this multicenter, double-blind, crossover study, 110 patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction were randomly assigned to a 6-week dose-escalation regimen of isosorbide mononitrate (from 30 mg to 60 mg to 120 mg once daily) or placebo, with subsequent crossover to the other group for 6 weeks. The primary end point was the daily activity level, quantified as the average daily accelerometer units during the 120-mg phase, as assessed by patient-worn accelerometers. Secondary end points included hours of activity per day during the 120-mg phase, daily accelerometer units during all three dose regimens, quality-of-life scores, 6-minute walk distance, and levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). RESULTS In the group receiving the 120-mg dose of isosorbide mononitrate, as compared with the placebo group, there was a nonsignificant trend toward lower daily activity (-381 accelerometer units; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -780 to 17; P = 0.06) and a significant decrease in hours of activity per day (-0.30 hours; 95\% CI, -0.55 to -0.05; P = 0.02). During all dose regimens, activity in the isosorbide mononitrate group was lower than that in the placebo group (-439 accelerometer units; 95\% CI, -792 to -86; P = 0.02). Activity levels decreased progressively and significantly with increased doses of isosorbide mononitrate (but not placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in the 6-minute walk distance, quality-of-life scores, or NT-proBNP levels. CONCLUSIONS Patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction who received isosorbide mononitrate were less active and did not have better quality of life or submaximal exercise capacity than did patients who received placebo.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Studies in experimental and human heart failure suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors may enhance cardiovascular function and thus exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with placebo on exercise capacity and clinical status in HFPEF. DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 216 stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction {$\geq$}50\%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity. Participants were randomized from October 2008 through February 2012 at 26 centers in North America. Follow-up was through August 30, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Sildenafil (n = 113) or placebo (n = 103) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point was change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included change in 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite clinical status score (range, 1-n, a higher value indicates better status; expected value with no treatment effect, 95) based on time to death, time to cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization, and change in quality of life for participants without cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization at 24 weeks. RESULTS: Median age was 69 years, and 48\% of patients were women. At baseline, median peak oxygen consumption (11.7 mL/kg/min) and 6-minute walk distance (308 m) were reduced. The median E/e' (16), left atrial volume index (44 mL/m2), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (41 mm Hg) were consistent with chronically elevated left ventricular filling pressures. At 24 weeks, median (IQR) changes in peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) in patients who received placebo (-0.20 [IQR, -0.70 to 1.00]) or sildenafil (-0.20 [IQR, -1.70 to 1.11]) were not significantly different (P = .90) in analyses in which patients with missing week-24 data were excluded, and in sensitivity analysis based on intention to treat with multiple imputation for missing values (mean between-group difference, 0.01 mL/kg/min, [95\% CI, -0.60 to 0.61]). The mean clinical status rank score was not significantly different at 24 weeks between placebo (95.8) and sildenafil (94.2) (P = .85). Changes in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks in patients who received placebo (15.0 m [IQR, -26.0 to 45.0]) or sildenafil (5.0 m [IQR, -37.0 to 55.0]; P = .92) were also not significantly different. Adverse events occurred in 78 placebo patients (76\%) and 90 sildenafil patients (80\%). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 placebo patients (16\%) and 25 sildenafil patients (22\%). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with HFPEF, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with administration of sildenafil for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity or clinical status.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nitrates are commonly prescribed to enhance activity tolerance in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction. We compared the effect of isosorbide mononitrate or placebo on daily activity in such patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, crossover study, 110 patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction were randomly assigned to a 6-week dose-escalation regimen of isosorbide mononitrate (from 30 mg to 60 mg to 120 mg once daily) or placebo, with subsequent crossover to the other group for 6 weeks. The primary end point was the daily activity level, quantified as the average daily accelerometer units during the 120-mg phase, as assessed by patient-worn accelerometers. Secondary end points included hours of activity per day during the 120-mg phase, daily accelerometer units during all three dose regimens, quality-of-life scores, 6-minute walk distance, and levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). RESULTS: In the group receiving the 120-mg dose of isosorbide mononitrate, as compared with the placebo group, there was a nonsignificant trend toward lower daily activity (-381 accelerometer units; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -780 to 17; P=0.06) and a significant decrease in hours of activity per day (-0.30 hours; 95\% CI, -0.55 to -0.05; P=0.02). During all dose regimens, activity in the isosorbide mononitrate group was lower than that in the placebo group (-439 accelerometer units; 95\% CI, -792 to -86; P=0.02). Activity levels decreased progressively and significantly with increased doses of isosorbide mononitrate (but not placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in the 6-minute walk distance, quality-of-life scores, or NT-proBNP levels. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction who received isosorbide mononitrate were less active and did not have better quality of life or submaximal exercise capacity than did patients who received placebo.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study investigates the prognostic impact of body mass index (BMI) in patients hospitalized with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). BACKGROUND: Limited data regarding the prognostic impact of BMI in patients with HFmrEF is available. METHODS: Consecutive patients with HFmrEF (ie, left ventricular ejection fraction 41-49\% and signs and/or symptoms of HF) were retrospectively included at one institution from 2016 to 2022. Risk stratification was performed according to WHO-defined BMI groups. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 months (median follow-up). Kaplan-Meier, uni- and multivariable Cox proportional regression analyses were applied for statistics. RESULTS: 1832 consecutive patients with HFmrEF were included with a median BMI of 26.7 kg/m2 (IQR 24.0-30.8 kg/m2). Patients with lowest BMI (ie, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) were associated with highest risk of all-cause mortality at 30 months compared to patients with higher BMI values (40.0\% vs 29.0\% vs 21.4\% vs 20.9\%; log rank p = 0.001; HR = 0.721; 95\% CI 0.656-0.793; p = 0.001). Even after multivariable adjustment, higher BMI values were associated with improved survival at 30 months (HR = 0.963; 95\% CI 0.943-0.985; p = 0.001). In contrast, the risk of HF- related rehospitalization at 30 months was not affected by BMI (log rank p = 0.064). CONCLUSION: In patients hospitalized with HFmrEF, lower BMI was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30 months, suggesting an obesity paradox in HFmrEF.},

METHODS: Prospective study of 4,061 white and black adults without CVD at baseline in 1985-1986 (age 18-30 years) from the multicenter, community-based CARDIA study. Time-varying excess body mass index (BMI)- and waist circumference (WC)-years were calculated as products of the degree and duration of excess overall (BMI\,{$\geq$}\,25 kg/m(2)) and abdominal adiposity [WC {$>$}94 cm (men) and {$>$}80 cm (women)], respectively, collected at up to eight examinations. RESULTS: During a median of 24.8 years, there were 125 incident CVD, 62 coronary heart disease (CHD), and 33 heart failure (HF) events. Adjusted hazard ratios for CVD, CHD, and HF for each additional 50 excess BMI-years were 1.20 (1.08, 1.34), 1.25 (1.07, 1.46), and 1.45 (1.23, 1.72), respectively. For each 50 excess WC-years, these hazard ratios were 1.10 (1.04, 1.18), 1.13 (1.03, 1.24), and 1.22 (1.11, 1.34), respectively. Akaike information criterion values were lowest in models containing time-varying excess BMI- or WC-years compared to those including time-varying BMI or WC only. CONCLUSIONS: Excess BMI- and WC-years are predictors of the risk of CVD and may provide a better indicator of the cumulative exposure to excess adiposity than BMI or WC only.},

ACE2 is a newly identified member of this system, which converts angiotensin II to angiotensin, and of which the occurrence in plasma has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the heritability of circulating ACE, ACE2, and neprilysin (NEP), which may also be a regulator of BP, in a family study, and to determine covariates that contribute to the variation in plasma activity. ACE, ACE2, and NEP activities were measured in plasma from 534 subjects in the Leeds Family Study using selective fluorogenic substrates. Genetic factors accounted for 24.5\%, 67\%, and 22.7\% of the phenotypic variation in circulating ACE, ACE2, and NEP, respectively. ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism and other measured covariates accounted for 23.8\% of variance in circulating ACE. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was a significant determinant of circulating ACE2. Measured covariates accounted for 17.3\% of variation in circulating NEP. ACE and NEP were associated with systolic and diastolic BP in univariate analyses; however, only ACE was independently associated with systolic and diastolic BP after accounting for covariates and shared childhood household.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modifiable lifestyle factors in relation to risk for cardiomyopathy, a common and increasing cause of heart failure in the young, have not been widely studied. We sought to investigate a potential link between obesity, a recognized predictor of early heart failure, in adolescence and being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in adulthood. METHODS: This was a nationwide register-based prospective cohort study of 1\,668\,893 adolescent men (mean age, 18.3 years; SD, 0.7 years) who enlisted for compulsory military service from 1969 to 2005. At baseline, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and medical disorders were registered, along with test results for fitness and muscle strength. Cardiomyopathy diagnoses were identified from the National Hospital Register and Cause of Death Register during an up to 46-year follow-up and divided into categories: dilated, hypertrophic, alcohol/drug-induced, and other. Hazard ratios were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 27 years; Q1-Q3, 19-35 years), 4477 cases of cardiomyopathy were identified, of which 2631 (59\%) were dilated, 673 (15\%) were hypertrophic, and 480 (11\%) were alcohol/drug-induced. Increasing BMI was strongly associated with elevated risk of cardiomyopathy, especially dilated, starting at levels considered normal (BMI, 22.5-{$<$}25 kg/m2; hazard ratio, 1.38 [95\% CI, 1.22-1.57]), adjusted for age, year, center, and baseline comorbidities, and with a {$>$}8-fold increased risk at BMI {$\geq$}35 kg/m2 compared with BMI of 18.5 to {$<$}20 kg/m2. For each 1-unit increase in BMI, similarly adjusted hazard ratios were 1.15 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.17) for dilated cardiomyopathy, 1.09 (95\% CI, 1.06-1.12) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 1.10 (1.06-1.13) for alcohol/drug-induced cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Even mildly elevated body weight in late adolescence may contribute to being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in adulthood. The already marked importance of weight control in youth is further strengthened by these findings, as well as greater evidence for obesity as a potential important cause of adverse cardiac remodeling that is independent of clinically evident ischemic heart disease.},

  abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Rapid progression of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Most previous studies looking for genetic factors associated with low eGFR have used cross-sectional data. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD, focusing on longitudinal data. They identified three loci (two of them novel) associated with longitudinal eGFR decline. In addition to the known UMOD/PDILT locus, variants within BICC1 were associated with significant differences in longitudinal eGFR slope. Variants within HEATR4 also were associated with differences in eGFR decline, but only among Black/African American individuals without diabetes. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline in CKD and may inform new therapeutic approaches for progressive kidney disease. BACKGROUND: Rapid progression of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite extensive study of the genetics of cross-sectional eGFR, only a few loci associated with eGFR decline over time have been identified. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD-defined by two outpatient eGFR measurements of {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , obtained 90-365 days apart-from the Million Veteran Program and Vanderbilt University Medical Center's DNA biobank. The primary outcome was the annualized relative slope in outpatient eGFR. Analyses were stratified by ethnicity and diabetes status and meta-analyzed thereafter. RESULTS: In cross-ancestry meta-analysis, the strongest association was rs77924615, near UMOD / PDILT ; each copy of the G allele was associated with a 0.30\%/yr faster eGFR decline ( P = 4.9{\texttimes}10 -27 ). We also observed an association within BICC1 (rs11592748), where every additional minor allele was associated with a 0.13\%/yr slower eGFR decline ( P = 5.6{\texttimes}10 -9 ). Among participants without diabetes, the strongest association was the UMOD/PDILT variant rs36060036, associated with a 0.27\%/yr faster eGFR decline per copy of the C allele ( P = 1.9{\texttimes}10 -17 ). Among Black participants, a significantly faster eGFR decline was associated with variant rs16996674 near APOL1 (R 2 =0.29 with the G1 high-risk genotype); among Black participants with diabetes, lead variant rs11624911 near HEATR4 also was associated with a significantly faster eGFR decline. We also nominally replicated loci with known associations with eGFR decline, near PRKAG2, FGF5, and C15ORF54. CONCLUSIONS: Three loci were significantly associated with longitudinal eGFR change at genome-wide significance. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for progressive CKD.},

Most previous studies looking for genetic factors associated with low eGFR have used cross-sectional data. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD, focusing on longitudinal data. They identified three loci (two of them novel) associated with longitudinal eGFR decline. In addition to the known UMOD/PDILT locus, variants within BICC1 were associated with significant differences in longitudinal eGFR slope. Variants within HEATR4 also were associated with differences in eGFR decline, but only among Black/African American individuals without diabetes. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline in CKD and may inform new therapeutic approaches for progressive kidney disease.           Background~           Rapid progression of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite extensive study of the genetics of cross-sectional eGFR, only a few loci associated with eGFR decline over time have been identified.           Methods~           We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD---defined by two outpatient eGFR measurements of {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, obtained 90--365 days apart---from the Million Veteran Program and Vanderbilt University Medical Center's DNA biobank. The primary outcome was the annualized relative slope in outpatient eGFR. Analyses were stratified by ethnicity and diabetes status and meta-analyzed thereafter.           Results~           In cross-ancestry meta-analysis, the strongest association was rs77924615, near UMOD/PDILT; each copy of the G allele was associated with a 0.30\%/yr faster eGFR decline (P = 4.9{\texttimes}10-27). We also observed an association within BICC1 (rs11592748), where every additional minor allele was associated with a 0.13\%/yr slower eGFR decline (P = 5.6{\texttimes}10-9). Among participants without diabetes, the strongest association was the UMOD/PDILT variant rs36060036, associated with a 0.27\%/yr faster eGFR decline per copy of the C allele (P = 1.9{\texttimes}10-17). Among Black participants, a significantly faster eGFR decline was associated with variant rs16996674 near APOL1 (R2=0.29 with the G1 high-risk genotype); among Black participants with diabetes, lead variant rs11624911 near HEATR4 also was associated with a significantly faster eGFR decline. We also nominally replicated loci with known associations with eGFR decline, near PRKAG2, FGF5, and C15ORF54.           Conclusions~           Three loci were significantly associated with longitudinal eGFR change at genome-wide significance. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for progressive CKD.

BACKGROUND: Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been associated with cardiac dysfunction. However, long-term data on the risk of HF are limited. METHODS: We studied 3,044 adults{$>$}or=65 years of age who initially were free of HF in the Cardiovascular Health Study. We compared adjudicated HF events over a mean 12-year follow-up and changes in cardiac function over the course of 5 years among euthyroid participants, those with subclinical hypothyroidism (subdivided by thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] levels: 4.5 to 9.9, {$>$}or=10.0 mU/l), and those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. RESULTS: Over the course of 12 years, 736 participants developed HF events. Participants with TSH{$>$}or=10.0 mU/l had a greater incidence of HF compared with euthyroid participants (41.7 vs. 22.9 per 1,000 person years, p=0.01; adjusted hazard ratio: 1.88; 95\% confidence interval: 1.05 to 3.34). Baseline peak E velocity, which is an echocardiographic measurement of diastolic function associated with incident HF in the CHS cohort, was greater in those patients with TSH{$>$}or=10.0 mU/l compared with euthyroid participants (0.80 m/s vs. 0.72 m/s, p=0.002). Over the course of 5 years, left ventricular mass increased among those with TSH{$>$}or=10.0 mU/l, but other echocardiographic measurements were unchanged. Those patients with TSH 4.5 to 9.9 mU/l or with subclinical hyperthyroidism had no increase in risk of HF. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with euthyroid older adults, those adults with TSH{$>$}or=10.0 mU/l have a moderately increased risk of HF and alterations in cardiac function but not older adults with TSH{$<$}10.0 mU/l. Clinical trials should assess whether the risk of HF might be ameliorated by thyroxine replacement in individuals with TSH{$>$}or=10.0 mU/l.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of severe and complex obesity is increasing worldwide and surgery may offer an effective and lasting treatment. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery are the two main surgical procedures performed. DESIGN: This open parallel-group randomised controlled trial will compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of gastric band (Band) versus gastric bypass (Bypass) in adults with severe and complex obesity. It has an internal pilot phase (in two centres) with integrated qualitative research to establish effective and optimal methods for recruitment. Adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or more, or a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or more and other co-morbidities will be recruited. At the end of the internal pilot the study will expand into more centres if the pre-set progression criteria of numbers and rates of eligible patients screened and randomised are met and if the expected rates of retention and adherence to treatment allocation are achieved. The trial will test the joint hypotheses that Bypass is non-inferior to Band with respect to more than 50\% excess weight loss and that Bypass is superior to Band with respect to health related quality of life (HRQOL, EQ-5D) at three years. Secondary outcomes include other weight loss measures, waist circumference and remission/resolution of co-morbidities; generic and symptom-specific HRQOL; nutritional blood test results; resource use; eating behaviours and adverse events. A core outcome set for reporting the results of obesity surgery will be developed and a systematic review of the evidence for sleeve gastrectomy undertaken to inform the main study design. DISCUSSION: By-Band is the first pragmatic study to compare the two most commonly performed bariatric surgical procedures for severe and complex obesity. The design will enable and empower surgeons to learn to recruit and participate in a randomised study. Early evidence shows that timely recruitment is possible.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the incidence of heart failure has declined and survival after heart failure diagnosis has improved over time but that secular trends have diverged by sex. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Patients were 4537 Olmsted County residents (57\% women; mean [SD] age, 74 [14] years) with a diagnosis of heart failure between 1979 and 2000. Framingham criteria and clinical criteria were used to validate the diagnosis MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of heart failure and survival after heart failure diagnosis. RESULTS: The incidence of heart failure was higher among men (378/100 000 persons; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 361-395 for men; 289/100 000 persons; 95\% CI, 277-300 for women) and did not change over time among men or women. After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years (range, 0-23.8 years), 3347 deaths occurred, including 1930 among women and 1417 among men. Survival after heart failure diagnosis was worse among men than women (relative risk, 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.24-1.43) but overall improved over time (5-year age-adjusted survival, 43\% in 1979-1984 vs 52\% in 1996-2000, P{$<$}.001). However, men and younger persons experienced larger survival gains, contrasting with less or no improvement for women and elderly persons. CONCLUSION: In this community-based cohort, the incidence of heart failure has not declined during 2 decades, but survival after onset of heart failure has increased overall, with less improvement among women and elderly persons.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective cohort study, men from the Swedish Conscript Registry investigated 1968-2005 (n = 1 610 437; mean age, 18.6 years were followed 5-42 years (median, 23.0 years; interquartile range, 15.0-32.0), 5492 first hospitalizations for heart failure occurred (mean age at diagnosis, 46.6 (SD 8.0) years). Compared with men with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-20.0 kg/m2, men with a BMI 20.0-22.5 kg/m2 had an hazard ratio (HR) of 1.22 (95\% CI, 1.10-1.35), after adjustment for age, year of conscription, comorbidities at baseline, parental education, blood pressure, IQ, muscle strength, and fitness. The risk rose incrementally with increasing BMI such that men with a BMI of 30-35 kg/m2 had an adjusted HR of 6.47 (95\% CI, 5.39-7.77) and those with a BMI of {$\geq$}35 kg/m2 had an HR of 9.21 (95\% CI, 6.57-12.92). The multiple-adjusted risk of heart failure per 1 unit increase in BMI ranged from 1.06 (95\% CI, 1.02-1.11) in heart failure associated with valvular disease to 1.20 (95\% CI, 1.18-1.22) for cases associated with coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension. CONCLUSION: We found a steeply rising risk of early heart failure detectable already at a normal body weight, increasing nearly 10-fold in the highest weight category. Given the current obesity epidemic, heart failure in the young may increase substantially in the future and physicians need to be aware of this.},

However, a growing body of evidence emphasizes the role of natriuretic peptides in the energy metabolism of several substrates in humans and animals, thus interrelating the heart, as an endocrine organ, with various insulin-sensitive tissues and organs such as adipose tissue, muscle skeletal, and liver. Adipose tissue dysfunction is associated with altered regulation of the natriuretic peptide system, also indicated as a natriuretic disability. Evidence points to a contribution of this natriuretic disability to the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiometabolic complications; although the causal relationship is not fully understood at present. However, targeting the natriuretic peptide pathway may improve metabolic health in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review will focus on the current literature on the metabolic functions of natriuretic peptides with emphasis on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Natriuretic peptide system alterations could be proposed as one of the linking mechanisms between adipose tissue dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.},

There were significant associations between Leu, Phe, and Met with cardiovascular risk variables and prognosis. In conclusion, plasma Leu, Phe, and Met provide early prediction and prognostic values of HF.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) is the visceral adipose tissue compartment surrounding the heart. Experimental and observational research has suggested that greater PAT deposition might mediate cardiovascular disease, independent of general or subcutaneous adiposity. We characterize the genetic architecture of adiposity-adjusted PAT and identify causal associations between PAT and adverse cardiac magnetic resonance imaging measures of cardiac structure and function in 28\,161 UK Biobank participants. METHODS AND RESULTS The PAT phenotype was extracted from cardiac magnetic resonance images using an automated image analysis tool previously developed and validated in this cohort. A genome-wide association study was performed with PAT area set as the phenotype, adjusting for age, sex, and other measures of obesity. Functional mapping and Bayesian colocalization were used to understand the biologic role of identified variants. Mendelian randomization analysis was used to examine potential causal links between genetically determined PAT and cardiac magnetic resonance-derived measures of left ventricular structure and function. We discovered 12 genome-wide significant variants, with 2 independent sentinel variants (rs6428792, P=4.20{\texttimes}10-9 and rs11992444, P=1.30{\texttimes}10-12) at 2 distinct genomic loci, that were mapped to 3 potentially causal genes: T-box transcription factor 15 (TBX15), tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial (WARS2) and early B-cell factor-2 (EBF2) through functional annotation. Bayesian colocalization additionally suggested a role of RP4-712E4.1. Genetically predicted differences in adiposity-adjusted PAT were causally associated with adverse left ventricular remodeling. CONCLUSIONS This study provides insights into the genetic architecture determining differential PAT deposition, identifies causal links with left structural and functional parameters, and provides novel data about the pathophysiological importance of adiposity distribution.},

Mediation analysis is the method of decomposing the effects of an exposure on an outcome, which act directly, and those that act via mediating variables. These effects are decomposed through the use of multivariable analysis to estimate the causal effects between three types of variables: exposures, mediators, and an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) is a recent extension to MR that uses genetic variants associated with multiple, potentially related exposures to estimate the effect of each exposure on a single outcome. MVMR allows for equivalent analysis to mediation within the MR framework and therefore can also be used to estimate mediation effects. This approach retains the benefits of using genetic instruments for causal inference, such as avoiding bias due to confounding, while allowing for estimation of the different effects required for mediation analysis. This review explains MVMR, what is estimated when one exposure is a mediator of another in an MVMR estimation, and how MR and MVMR can therefore be used to estimate mediated effects. This review then goes on to consider the advantages and limitations of using MR and MVMR to conduct mediation analysis.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is the use of genetic variants associated with an exposure to estimate the causal effect of that exposure on an outcome. Mediation analysis is the method of decomposing the effects of an exposure on an outcome, which act directly, and those that act via mediating variables. These effects are decomposed through the use of multivariable analysis to estimate the causal effects between three types of variables: exposures, mediators, and an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) is a recent extension to MR that uses genetic variants associated with multiple, potentially related exposures to estimate the effect of each exposure on a single outcome. MVMR allows for equivalent analysis to mediation within the MR framework and therefore can also be used to estimate mediation effects. This approach retains the benefits of using genetic instruments for causal inference, such as avoiding bias due to confounding, while allowing for estimation of the different effects required for mediation analysis. This review explains MVMR, what is estimated when one exposure is a mediator of another in an MVMR estimation, and how MR and MVMR can therefore be used to estimate mediated effects. This review then goes on to consider the advantages and limitations of using MR and MVMR to conduct mediation analysis.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 17 913 patients in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation trial had body mass index (BMI) measured at baseline. For the primary analysis, BMI was categorized as normal (18.5 to {$<$}25 kg/m2), overweight (25 to {$<$}30 kg/m2), and obese ({$\geq$}30 kg/m2). Waist circumference (WC) was defined as high if {$>$}102 cm for men and {$>$}88 cm in women. Outcomes were stroke or systemic embolism, a composite endpoint (stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, or all-cause mortality), all-cause mortality, and major bleeding. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) across categories of BMI and WC adjusting for established risk factors and treatment allocation. At baseline, 4052 (22.6\%) patients had a normal BMI, 6702 (37.4\%) were overweight, and 7159 (40.0\%) were obese. In multivariable analyses, higher BMI was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality [overweight: HR 0.67 (95\% CI 0.59-0.78); obese: HR 0.63 (95\% CI 0.54-0.74), P {$<$} 0.0001] and the composite endpoint [overweight: HR 0.74 (95\% CI 0.65-0.84); obese: HR 0.68 (95\% CI 0.60-0.78), P {$<$} 0.0001] compared with normal BMI. In women, high WC was associated with a 31\% lower risk of all-cause mortality (P = 0.001), 27\% lower risk of the composite endpoint (P = 0.001), and 28\% lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism (P = 0.048) but not in men. There was no significant association between adiposity and major bleeding. CONCLUSION: In patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulants, higher BMI and WC are associated with a more favourable prognosis.},

Overt hypothyroidism is associated with modest weight gain, but there is a lack of clarity regarding subclinical hypothyroidism. Novel view indicates that changes in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) could well be secondary to obesity. The increasing prevalence of obesity further confounds definition of normal TSH range in population studies. Thyroid autoantibody status may help in establishing the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism in obesity. High leptin levels may play a role in the hyperthyrotropinemia of obesity and also increase susceptibility to thyroid autoimmunity and subsequent hypothyroidism. There is at most a modest effect of L-T4 treatment in overt hypothyroidism in inducing weight loss; benefit in subclinical hypothyroidism is not established with no data supporting thyroid hormone use in euthyroid obese patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, uncertainty regarding kidney outcomes persists and whether benefits extend to exendin-4-based GLP-1 receptor remains uncertain. We aimed to meta-analyse the most up-to-date evidence on the cardiovascular benefits and risks of GLP-1 receptor agonists from outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis, including new data from AMPLITUDE-O, using a random effects model to estimate overall hazard ratio (HR) for MACE; its components; all-cause mortality; hospital admission for heart failure; a composite kidney outcome consisting of development of macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, or at least 40\% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), kidney replacement therapy, or death due to kidney disease; worsening of kidney function, based on eGFR change; and odds ratios for key safety outcomes (severe hypoglycaemia, retinopathy, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer). We also examined MACE outcome in patient subgroups on the basis of MACE incidence rates in the placebo group, presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, HbA1c level, trial duration, treatment dosing interval, structural homology to human GLP-1 or exendin-4, BMI, age, and eGFR. We searched PubMed for eligible trials reporting MACE (ie, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke), up to June 9, 2021. We meta-analysed data from published randomised placebo-controlled trials testing either injectable or oral GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. We restricted the search to trials of more than 500 patients with a primary outcome that included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. This meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO, CRD42021259711. FINDINGS: Of 98 articles screened, eight trials comprising 60\,080 patients fulfilled the prespecified criteria and were included. Overall, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced MACE by 14\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}86 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}80-0{$\cdot$}93]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), with no significant heterogeneity across GLP-1 receptor agonist structural homology or eight other examined subgroups (all pinteraction{$\geq$}0{$\cdot$}14). GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced all-cause mortality by 12\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}88 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}82-0{$\cdot$}94]; p=0{$\cdot$}0001), hospital admission for heart failure by 11\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}89 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}82-0{$\cdot$}98]; p=0{$\cdot$}013), and the composite kidney outcome by 21\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}79 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}73-0{$\cdot$}87]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), with no increase in risk of severe hypoglycaemia, retinopathy, or pancreatic adverse effects. In sensitivity analyses removing the only trial restricted to patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ELIXA), all benefits marginally increased, including the outcome of worsening of kidney function, based on eGFR change (HR 0{$\cdot$}82 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}69-0{$\cdot$}98]; p=0{$\cdot$}030). INTERPRETATION: GLP-1 receptor agonists, regardless of structural homology, reduced the risk of individual MACE components, all-cause mortality, hospital admission for heart failure, and worsening kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes. FUNDING: None.},

Most chronic conditions are, to differing extents, caused or exacerbated by excess adiposity, but weight management is rarely discussed or attempted for patients. Furthermore, progressive symptoms usually attributed to ageing (eg, musculoskeletal pains, fatigue, and breathlessness), and which create considerable health-care demands, can also be attributed to the accumulation of body fat over time. For many symptoms and diseases that are more frequently reported in people with excess adiposity (such as depression), there exist potentially multidirectional, causal relationships that generate a cycle of clinical and social deterioration. There is insufficient research on the effects of effective weight management on these clinically demanding, age and weight-mediated symptoms. Based on current evidence, we suggest that policy makers need to be more proactive in obesity prevention and effective weight management should receive research funding to match the search for novel therapeutics for secondary chronic diseases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the associations of obesity and cardiometabolic traits with incident heart failure with preserved versus reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF vs. HFrEF). Given known sex differences in HF subtype, we examined men and women separately. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that obesity confers greater risk of HFpEF versus HFrEF. Contributions of associated metabolic traits to HFpEF are less clear. METHODS: We studied 22,681 participants from 4 community-based cohorts followed for incident HFpEF versus HFrEF (ejection fraction {$\geq$}50\% vs.~{$<$}50\%). We evaluated the association of body mass index (BMI) and cardiometabolic traits with incident HF subtype using Cox models. RESULTS: The mean age was 60 {\textpm} 13 years, and 53\% were women. Over a median follow-up of 12 years, 628 developed incident HFpEF and 835 HFrEF. Greater BMI portended higher risk of HFpEF compared with HFrEF (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.34 per 1-SD increase in BMI; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24 to 1.45 vs. HR: 1.18; 95\% CI: 1.10 to 1.27). Similarly, insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) was associated with HFpEF (HR: 1.20 per 1-SD; 95\% CI: 1.05 to 1.37), but not HFrEF (HR: 0.99; 95\% CI: 0.88 to 1.11; p~{$<$} 0.05 for difference HFpEF vs. HFrEF). We found that the differential association of BMI with HFpEF versus HFrEF was more pronounced among women (p for difference HFpEF vs. HFrEF~= 0.01) when compared with men (p~= 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and related cardiometabolic traits including insulin resistance are more strongly associated with risk of future HFpEF versus HFrEF. The differential risk of HFpEF with obesity seems particularly pronounced among~women and may underlie sex differences in HF subtypes.},

BACKGROUND: It is not known whether obesity, commonly paralleled by insulin resistance, inflammation, and leptin, is independently associated with coronary circulatory dysfunction. METHODS: Myocardial blood flow (MBF) responses to cold pressor test (CPT) and pharmacologic vasodilation was measured with positron emission tomography and 13N-ammonia. Study participants were divided into three groups based on their body mass index (BMI, kg/m2): control, 20 {$<$} or = BMI {$<$}25 (n = 19); overweight, 25 {$<$} or = BMI {$<$}30 (n = 21); and obese, BMI {$>$}30 (n = 32). RESULTS: Body mass index was significantly correlated to the Homeostasis Model Assessment Index of insulin resistance and C-reactive protein levels (r = 0.60 and r = 0.47, p {$<$} 0.0001). Compared with control subjects, endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in overweight and obese groups (0.32 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.19 and 0.07 +/- 0.16 ml/g/min; p {$<$} 0.03 and p {$<$} 0.0001). The dipyridamole-induced total vasodilator capacity was significantly lower in obese than in control subjects (1.77 +/- 0.51 vs. 2.04 +/- 0.37 ml/g/min, p {$<$} 0.02). On multivariate analysis, BMI (p {$<$} 0.012) and age (p {$<$} 0.035) were significant independent predictors of DeltaMBF. Finally, only in the obese group leptin plasma levels significantly correlated with DeltaMBF (r = 0.37, p {$<$} 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Increased body weight is independently associated with abnormal coronary circulatory function that progresses from an impairment in endothelium-related coronary vasomotion in overweight individuals to an impairment of the total vasodilator capacity in obese individuals. The findings that elevated leptin plasma levels in patients that are obese might exert beneficial effects on the coronary endothelium to counterbalance the adverse effects of increases in body weight on coronary circulatory function should be tested.},

Still the mechanisms controlling human adipose tissue angiotensin II concentrations are not yet known. We investigated whether angiotensin II is degraded by human primary cultured preadipocytes and adipocytes and which enzymes are responsible for its metabolism. Distinct but transient angiotensin II production was limited by degradation due to consecutive proteolytic cleavage by endopeptidase and aminopeptidase activities. The endopeptidase could be identified as neprilysin expressed on the surface of both preadipocytes and adipocytes. Degradation of angiotensin II was preceded by a lag phase that was considerably longer in preadipocytes. This time span could not be explained by an induction of neprilysin nor by an increase in its surface localization. Following the lag phase, adipocytes showed a higher degradation activity than preadipocytes as mirrored by increased neprilysin levels and activity measured in their membrane fractions. Our findings demonstrate that human preadipocytes and adipocytes differentially express functional neprilysin and aminopeptidase activity involved in the regulation of angiotensin II concentrations in human adipose tissue.},

Here we report how the `no horizontal pleiotropy assumption' is strengthened when proteins are the risk factors of interest. Proteins are typically the proximal effectors of biological processes encoded in the genome. Moreover, proteins are the targets of most medicines, so MR studies of drug targets are becoming a fundamental tool in drug development. To enable such studies, we introduce a mathematical framework that contrasts MR analysis of proteins with that of risk factors located more distally in the causal chain from gene to disease. We illustrate key model decisions and introduce an analytical framework for maximising power and evaluating the robustness of analyses.},

  abstract = {While volunteer-based studies such as the UK Biobank have become the cornerstone of genetic epidemiology, the participating individuals are rarely representative of their target population. To evaluate the impact of selective participation, here we derived UK Biobank participation probabilities on the basis of 14 variables harmonized across the UK Biobank and a representative sample. We then conducted weighted genome-wide association analyses on 19 traits. Comparing the output from weighted genome-wide association analyses (neffective\,=\,94,643 to 102,215) with that from standard genome-wide association analyses (n\,=\,263,464 to 283,749), we found that increasing representativeness led to changes in SNP effect sizes and identified novel SNP associations for 12 traits. While heritability estimates were less impacted by weighting (maximum change in h2, 5\%), we found substantial discrepancies for genetic correlations (maximum change in rg, 0.31) and Mendelian randomization estimates (maximum change in {$\beta$}STD, 0.15) for socio-behavioural traits. We urge the field to increase representativeness in biobank samples, especially when studying genetic correlates of behaviour, lifestyles and social outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:In observational analyses, higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease events. However, whether raising HDL cholesterol levels therapeutically reduces cardiovascular risk remains uncertain. Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) raises HDL cholesterol levels and might therefore improve cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS:We randomly assigned 15,871 patients who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome to receive the CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib, at a dose of 600 mg daily, or placebo, in addition to the best available evidence-based care. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, unstable angina, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. RESULTS:At the time of randomization, the mean HDL cholesterol level was 42 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter), and the mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was 76 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter). Over the course of the trial, HDL cholesterol levels increased from baseline by 4 to 11\% in the placebo group and by 31 to 40\% in the dalcetrapib group. Dalcetrapib had a minimal effect on LDL cholesterol levels. Patients were followed for a median of 31 months. At a prespecified interim analysis that included 1135 primary end-point events (71\% of the projected total number), the independent data and safety monitoring board recommended termination of the trial for futility. As compared with placebo, dalcetrapib did not alter the risk of the primary end point (cumulative event rate, 8.0\% and 8.3\%, respectively; hazard ratio with dalcetrapib, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.16; P = 0.52) and did not have a significant effect on any component of the primary end point or total mortality. The median C-reactive protein level was 0.2 mg per liter higher and the mean systolic blood pressure was 0.6 mm Hg higher with dalcetrapib as compared with placebo (P{\textexclamdown}0.001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS:In patients who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome, dalcetrapib increased HDL cholesterol levels but did not reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. (Funded by F.

  abstract = {Objectives This study sought to define the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality in heart failure (HF) across the world and to identify specific groups in whom BMI may differentially mediate risk. Background Obesity is associated with incident HF, but it is paradoxically associated with better prognosis during chronic HF. Methods We studied 6,142 patients with acute decompensated HF from 12 prospective observational cohorts followed-up across 4 continents. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models and net reclassification index described associations of BMI with all-cause mortality. Results Normal-weight patients (BMI 18.5 to 25 kg/m2) were older with more advanced HF and lower cardiometabolic risk. Despite worldwide heterogeneity in clinical features across obesity categories, a higher BMI remained associated with decreased 30-day and 1-year mortality (11\% decrease at 30 days; 9\% decrease at 1 year per 5 kg/m2; p~{$<~$}0.05), after adjustment for clinical risk. The BMI obtained at index admission provided effective 1-year risk reclassification beyond current markers of clinical risk (net reclassification index 0.119, p~{$<$} 0.001). Notably, the ``protective'' association of BMI with mortality was confined to persons with older age ({$>$}75 years; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; p~= 0.006), decreased cardiac function (ejection fraction~{$<$}50\%; HR: 0.85; p~{$<$} 0.001), no diabetes (HR: 0.86; p~{$<$} 0.001), and de novo HF (HR: 0.89; p~= 0.004). Conclusions A lower BMI is associated with age, disease severity, and a higher risk of death in acute decompensated HF. The ``obesity paradox'' is confined to older persons, with decreased cardiac function, less cardiometabolic illness, and recent-onset HF, suggesting that aging, HF severity/chronicity, and metabolism may explain the obesity paradox.},

  abstract = {Emerging literature suggests that obesity may be "protective" against mortality and cardiovascular outcomes, while dysglycemia may worsen outcomes regardless of obesity. The authors measured the association of weight, smoking, and glycemia with mortality in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). Among 5423 ALLHAT participants without established diabetes or cardiovascular disease, 3980 (73\%) had normal fasting glucose and 1443 (27\%) had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) levels at study entry. After a median of 4.9 years follow-up, 554 (10\%) had died (37\% cardiovascular). IFG was associated with higher all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.50), while obesity was associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.60-0.96). However, after excluding underweight individuals (body mass index [BMI] {$<$}22 kg/m(2) ) and smokers, neither obesity nor IFG was associated with all-cause mortality [corrected]. Although obesity appeared protective against mortality, this association was not significant in never-smokers or after exclusion of BMI {$<$}22 kg/m(2) . The obesity paradox may result from confounding by a sicker, underweight referent population and smoking.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Obesity is present in up to 45\% of patients with heart failure (HF). Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist, facilitates weight loss in obese patients. The efficacy of liraglutide as a weight loss agent among patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and a recent acute HF hospitalization remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Functional Impact of GLP-1 for Heart Failure Treatment study randomized 300 patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction~{$\leq~$}40\%), both with and without diabetes and a recent HF hospitalization to liraglutide or placebo. The primary outcome for this post hoc analysis was the change in weight from baseline to last study visit. We conducted an 'on-treatment' analysis of patients with at least one follow-up visit on study drug (123 on liraglutide and 124 on placebo). The median age was 61~years, 21\% were female, and 69\% of patients had New York Heart Association functional Class III or IV symptoms. The median ejection fraction was 25\% (25th, 75th percentile 19-32\%). Liraglutide use was associated with a significant weight reduction [liraglutide -1.00~lbs vs. placebo 2.00~lbs; treatment difference -4.10~lbs; 95\% confidence interval (CI) -7.94, -0.25; P~=~0.0367; percentage treatment difference -2.07\%, 95\% CI -3.86, -0.28; P~=~0.0237]. Similar results were seen after multivariable adjustments. Liraglutide also significantly reduced triglyceride levels (liraglutide 7.5~mg/dL vs. placebo 12.0~mg/dL; treatment difference -33.1~mg/dL; 95\% CI -60.7, -5.6; P~=~0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide is an efficacious weight loss agent in patients with HFrEF. These findings will require further exploration in a well-powered cardiovascular outcomes trial.},

  abstract = {Clinical studies have indicated the existence of an "obesity paradox" in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), that is, reduced mortality in patients who have elevated body mass index (BMI) scores compared with normal-weight reference groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation of BMI with all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic HF though a systematic review and meta-analysis of published research. PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central, Scopus, web of science and Embase were searched for studies reporting rates of total mortality, cardiac mortality, and risk for hospitalization in patients with HF in various BMI categories ({$<$}20 kg/m(2) [low], 20 to 24.9 kg/m(2) [normal reference], 25 to 29.9 kg/m(2) [overweight], 30 to 34.9 [obese], and {$\geq$}35 kg/m(2) [severely obese]). Event rates were compared using a forest plot of relative risk (RR) using a random-effects model assuming interstudy heterogeneity. Two study investigators independently reviewed the 124 reports retrieved and identified 6 for final analyses (n = 22,807). After a mean follow-up period of 2.85 years, the risk for adverse events was highest in patients with low BMIs: total mortality RR 1.27 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 1.37), CV mortality RR 1.20 (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.43), and hospitalization RR 1.19 (95\% CI 1.09 to 1.30). Risk for CV mortality and hospitalization was lowest in overweight patients (RR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.70 to 0.90, and RR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.86 to 0.97, respectively). Increasing degree of obesity failed to achieve a statistically significant effect on CV mortality (RR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.05, and RR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.50 to 1.01, for obese and severely obese, respectively) and on hospitalization (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.92 to 1.07, and RR 1.28, 95\% CI 0.88 to 1.87, for obese and severely obese, respectively). In conclusion, risk for total mortality and CV mortality and hospitalization was highest in patients with chronic HF who were underweight as defined by low BMI, whereas risk for CV mortality and hospitalization was lowest in overweight subjects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although genetic factors contribute to the onset of heart failure (HF), no large-scale genome-wide investigation of HF risk has been published to date. We have investigated the association of 2,478,304 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with incident HF by meta-analyzing data from 4 community-based prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eligible participants for these analyses were of European or African ancestry and free of clinical HF at baseline. Each study independently conducted genome-wide scans and imputed data to the approximately 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HapMap. Within each study, Cox proportional hazards regression models provided age- and sex-adjusted estimates of the association between each variant and time to incident HF. Fixed-effect meta-analyses combined results for each single-nucleotide polymorphism from the 4 cohorts to produce an overall association estimate and P value. A genome-wide significance P value threshold was set a priori at 5.0x10(-7). During a mean follow-up of 11.5 years, 2526 incident HF events (12\%) occurred in 20 926 European-ancestry participants. The meta-analysis identified a genome-wide significant locus at chromosomal position 15q22 (1.4x10(-8)), which was 58.8 kb from USP3. Among 2895 African-ancestry participants, 466 incident HF events (16\%) occurred during a mean follow-up of 13.7 years. One genome-wide significant locus was identified at 12q14 (6.7x10(-8)), which was 6.3 kb from LRIG3. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 2 loci that were associated with incident HF and exceeded genome-wide significance. The findings merit replication in other community-based settings of incident HF.},

  abstract = {Failure of the human heart to maintain sufficient output of blood for the demands of the body, heart failure, is a common condition with high mortality even with modern therapeutic alternatives. To identify molecular determinants of mortality in patients with new-onset heart failure, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies and follow-up genotyping in independent populations. We identified and replicated an association for a genetic variant on chromosome 5q22 with 36\% increased risk of death in subjects with heart failure (rs9885413, P = 2.7x10-9). We provide evidence from reporter gene assays, computational predictions and epigenomic marks that this polymorphism increases activity of an enhancer region active in multiple human tissues. The polymorphism was further reproducibly associated with a DNA methylation signature in whole blood (P = 4.5x10-40) that also associated with allergic sensitization and expression in blood of the cytokine TSLP (P = 1.1x10-4). Knockdown of the transcription factor predicted to bind the enhancer region (NHLH1) in a human cell line (HEK293) expressing NHLH1 resulted in lower TSLP expression. In addition, we observed evidence of recent positive selection acting on the risk allele in populations of African descent. Our findings provide novel genetic leads to factors that influence mortality in patients with heart failure.},

This bias was referred to as index event bias. Here, we give a theoretical quantitative example of index event bias, showing that, as a result of selection of patients on the basis of previous disease: (1) risk factors become inversely associated when they are not in the unselected population, and (2) the crude association between the risk factor of interest and disease becomes biased toward the null.},

The accuracy of data from NHS Digital (now part of NHS England) for identifying hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), a key HF standard, is not clear. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of NHS Digital data for identifying HHF. Methods and results Patients experiencing at least one HHF, as determined by NHS Digital data, and age- and sex-matched patients not experiencing HHF, were identified from a prospective cohort study and underwent expert adjudication. Three code sets commonly used to identify HHF were applied to the data and compared with expert adjudication (I50: International Classification of Diseases-10 codes beginning I50; OIS: Clinical Commissioning Groups Outcomes Indicator Set; and NICOR: National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, used as the basis for the National Heart Failure Audit in England and Wales). Five hundred four patients underwent expert adjudication, of which 10 (2\%) were adjudicated to have experienced HHF. Specificity was high across all three code sets in the first diagnosis position \{I50: 96.2\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 94.1--97.7\%]; NICOR: 93.3\% [CI 90.8--95.4\%]; OIS: 95.6\% [CI 93.3--97.2\%]\} but decreased substantially as the number of diagnosis positions expanded. Sensitivity [40.0\% (CI 12.2--73.8\%)] and positive predictive value (PPV) [highest with I50: 17.4\% (CI 8.1--33.6\%)] were low in the first diagnosis position for all coding sets. PPV was higher for the National Heart Failure Audit criteria, albeit modestly [36.4\% (CI 16.6--62.2\%)]. Conclusions NHS Digital data were not able to accurately identify HHF and should not be used in isolation for this purpose.},

  abstract = {The positive association between overweight, obesity, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality is well established, even though this relation is typically U shaped with an increased risk also in low-weight subjects. However, being overweight or obese has been associated with a better prognosis in subjects suffering from chronic diseases, id est the "obesity paradox". In both community-dwelling and hospitalized patients with COPD, several studies have reported a significant protective effect of obesity on all-cause mortality, indicating that also in obstructive pulmonary diseases, an obesity paradox may be present. Interestingly, the "paradox" is more evident for subjects with severe bronchial obstruction (i.e., a lower FEV1), while in mild-moderate conditions, the weight-related mortality shows a behavior similar to that observed in the general population. Several factors may confound the relation between COPD, obesity and mortality. The lower FEV1 found in obese people may be linked to a restrictive defect rather than to an obstructive one. Due to the modified chest wall mechanical properties-related to increased fat mass-obese COPD patients may present, respect to their lean counterpart, a lower lung hyperinflation which is associated with higher mortality. The traditional classification of COPD attributes to obese "blue bloaters" a low-grade emphysema in opposition to lean "pink puffers"; the fact that emphysema extent is related to mortality may bias the relationship between weight and survival. It is also to underline that the majority of the studies, consider BMI rather than body composition (a better predictor of mortality) when studying the intriguing relation between weight, COPD, and mortality. Reverse bias has also to be taken into account, hypothesizing that an unintentional weight loss may be the deleterious factor related to mortality, rather than considering obesity a protective one. Further prospective studies are needed to shed light on the complexity of this emerging issue. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V: Narrative Review.},

  abstract = {Background:~           ``Obesity paradox'' refers to an association between obesity and reduced mortality (contrary to an expected increased mortality). A common explanation is collider stratification bias: unmeasured confounding induced by selection bias. Here, we test this supposition through a realistic generative model.           Methods:~           We quantify the collider stratification bias in a selected population using counterfactual causal analysis. We illustrate the bias for a range of scenarios, describing associations between exposure (obesity), outcome (mortality), mediator (in this example, diabetes) and an unmeasured confounder.           Results:~           Collider stratification leads to biased estimation of the causal effect of exposure on outcome. However, the bias is small relative to the causal relationships between the variables.           Conclusions:~           Collider bias can be a partial explanation of the obesity paradox, but unlikely to be the main explanation for a reverse direction of an association to a true causal relationship. Alternative explanations of the obesity paradox should be explored. See Video Abstract at https://links.lww.com/EDE/B51.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Neprilysin (NEP), a zinc metalloendopeptidase, has a role in blood pressure control and lipid metabolism. The present study tested the hypothesis that NEP is associated with insulin resistance and features of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a study of 318 healthy human subjects and in murine obesity, and investigated NEP production by adipocytes in-vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 318 white European males, plasma NEP was elevated in the MetS and increased progressively with increasing MetS components. Plasma NEP activity correlated with insulin, homoeostasis model assessment and body mass index (BMI) in all subjects (P{$<$}0.01). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and western blotting showed that in human pre-adipocytes NEP expression is upregulated 25- to 30-fold during differentiation into adipocytes. Microarray analysis of mRNA from differentiated human adipocytes confirmed high-NEP expression comparable with adiponectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In a murine model of diet-induced insulin resistance, plasma NEP levels were significantly higher in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed compared with normal chow diet (NCD)-fed animals (1642 {\textpm} 529 and 820 {\textpm} 487 pg {$\mu$}l(-1), respectively; P{$<$}0.01). Tissue NEP was increased in mesenteric fat in HFD compared with NCD-fed mice (P{$<$}0.05). NEP knockout mice did not display any changes in insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, or body and epididymal fat pad weight compared with wild-type mice. CONCLUSION: In humans, NEP activity correlated with BMI and measures of insulin resistance with increasing levels in subjects with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. NEP protein production in human adipocytes increased during cell differentiation and plasma and adipose tissue levels of NEP were increased in obese insulin-resistant mice. Our results indicate that NEP associates with cardiometabolic risk in the presence of insulin resistance and increases with obesity.},

We discuss potential pathways to muscle impairment in obese individuals and the consequences that joint obesity and muscle impairment may have on health and disability. Tantamount to this discussion is whether low muscle mass or, rather, muscle weakness should be used for the definition. RECENT FINDINGS: Excess energy intake, physical inactivity, low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and changes in hormonal milieu may lead to the development of so-called 'sarcopenic obesity'. It was originally believed that the culprit of age-related muscle weakness was a reduction in muscle mass, but it is now clear that changes in muscle composition and quality are predominant. We propose that the risk of adverse outcomes, such as functional limitation and mortality, is better estimated by considering jointly obesity and muscle strength rather than obesity and muscle mass and the term 'sarcopenic obesity' should be revisited. SUMMARY: Recognition of obese patients who have associated muscle problems is an essential goal for clinicians. Further research is needed to identify new target for prevention and cure of this important geriatric syndrome.},

Out of 152 recruited patients, 130 serum samples were subjected to the metabolomic analyses. The 3-month mortality rate was 24.6\% (32 patients). Metabolomic profiling by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy found that the serum levels of 2-hydroxybutyrate (2-HB), 3-hydoxybutyrate (3-HB), lactate, citrate, and tyrosine, were higher in patients who died within 3 months compared to those who were alive 3 months after onset of AHF, which was confirmed by univariable logistic regression analyses (p\,=\,0.009, p\,=\,0.005, p\,=\,0.008, p{$<$}0.001, and p{$<$}0.001, respectively). These associations still remained significant for all tested metabolites except for lactate after adjusting for established prognostic parameters in HF. In conclusion, serum levels of 2-HB, 3-HB, tyrosine, and citrate measured at admission are associated with an increased 3-month mortality rate in AHF patients and might thus be of prognostic value in AHF.},

The elucidation of the molecular underpinnings of this relationship is hampered by the extremely heterogeneous nature of obesity as a human trait. Recent technological advances have facilitated a more in-depth characterization of body composition at large-scale. At the pace of current data acquisition and resolution, it is realistic to improve characterization of obesity and to advise individuals based on detailed body composition combined with tissue-specific molecular signatures. Individualized predictions of health implications would enable more personalized and effective public health interventions.},

We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to estimate the causal associations between GERD and 10 CVD outcomes, as well as 14 cardiovascular risk factors. We used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies for GERD and the FinnGen consortium for CVD. We further investigated whether GERD correlated with cardiovascular risk factors and performed multivariable MR and mediation analyses to estimate the mediating effects of these risk factors on GERD-CVD progression. Sensitivity analyses and replication analyses were also performed. Our results indicated that GERD was positively associated with seven CVD outcomes with odds ratios of 1.26 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.15, 1.37] for coronary artery disease, 1.41 (95\% CI, 1.28, 1.57) for myocardial infarction, 1.34 (95\% CI, 1.19, 1.51) for atrial fibrillation, 1.34 (95\% CI, 1.21, 1.50) for heart failure, 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.18, 1.43) for any stroke, 1.19 (95\% CI, 1.06, 1.34) for ischemic stroke and 1.29 (95\% CI, 1.16, 1.44) for venous thromboembolism. Furthermore, GERD was associated with nine cardiovascular risk factors and major depressive disorder demonstrated significant mediation effects on the causal pathway linking GERD and any stroke. This study demonstrates that GERD is associated with seven CVD outcomes and nine cardiovascular risk factors. Importantly, GERD treatment may help prevent common CVD events.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Numerous studies have demonstrated that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a primary role in CVD development. Therefore, studies on the mechanisms of ncRNAs are essential for further efforts to prevent and treat CVDs. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a novel species of non-conventional ncRNAs that guide post-transcriptional modifications and the subsequent maturation of small nuclear RNA and ribosomal RNA. Evidently, snoRNAs are extensively expressed in human tissues and may regulate different illnesses. Particularly, as the next-generation sequencing techniques have progressed, snoRNAs have been shown to be differentially expressed in CVDs, suggesting that they may play a role in the occurrence and progression of cardiac illnesses. However, the molecular processes and signaling pathways underlying the function of snoRNAs remain unidentified. Therefore, it is of great value to comprehensively investigate the association between snoRNAs and CVDs. The aim of this review was to collate existing literature on the biogenesis, characteristics, and potential regulatory mechanisms of snoRNAs. In particular, we present a scientific update on these snoRNAs and their relevance to CVDs in an effort to cast new light on the functions of snoRNAs in the clinical diagnosis of CVDs.},

  abstract = {Background There are currently no treatments that stop or slow the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Case--control genome-wide association studies have identified variants associated with disease risk, but not progression. The objective of the current study was to identify genetic variants associated with PD progression. Methods We analyzed 3 large longitudinal cohorts: Tracking Parkinson's, Oxford Discovery, and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We included clinical data for 3364 patients with 12,144 observations (mean follow-up 4.2 years). We used a new method in PD, following a similar approach in Huntington's disease, in which we combined multiple assessments using a principal components analysis to derive scores for composite, motor, and cognitive progression. These scores were analyzed in linear regression in genome-wide association studies. We also performed a targeted analysis of the 90 PD risk loci from the latest case--control meta-analysis. Results There was no overlap between variants associated with PD risk, from case--control studies, and PD age at onset versus PD progression. The APOE {$\varepsilon$}4 tagging variant, rs429358, was significantly associated with composite and cognitive progression in PD. Conditional analysis revealed several independent signals in the APOE locus for cognitive progression. No single variants were associated with motor progression. However, in gene-based analysis, ATP8B2, a phospholipid transporter related to vesicle formation, was nominally associated with motor progression (P = 5.3 {\texttimes} 10-6). Conclusions We provide early evidence that this new method in PD improves measurement of symptom progression. We show that the APOE {$\varepsilon$}4 allele drives progressive cognitive impairment in PD. Replication of this method and results in independent cohorts are needed. {\copyright} 2020 The Authors.

Hundreds of computational resources such as databases and predictive platforms have been developed that can be applied for drug repurposing, making it challenging to select the right resource for a specific drug repurposing project. With the aim of helping to address this challenge, here we overview computational approaches to drug repurposing based on a comprehensive survey of available in silico resources using a purpose-built drug repurposing ontology that classifies the resources into hierarchical categories and provides application-specific information. We also present an expert evaluation of selected resources and three drug repurposing case studies implemented within the Horizon Europe REMEDi4ALL project to demonstrate the practical use of the resources. This comprehensive Review with expert evaluations and case studies provides guidelines and recommendations on the best use of various in silico resources for drug repurposing and establishes a basis for a sustainable and extendable drug repurposing web catalogue.},

  abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Substantial weight loss in type 2 diabetes can achieve a return to non-diabetic biochemical status, without the need for medication. The Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT), a cluster-randomised controlled trial, is testing a structured intervention designed to achieve and sustain this over 2~years in a primary care setting to determine practicability for routine clinical practice. This paper reports the characteristics of the baseline cohort. METHODS: People with type 2 diabetes for {$<$}6~years with a BMI of 27-45~kg/m2 were recruited in 49 UK primary care practices, randomised to either best-practice diabetes care alone or with an additional evidence-based weight management programme (Counterweight-Plus). The co-primary outcomes, at 12~months, are weight loss {$\geq$}15~kg and diabetes remission (HbA1c {$<$}48~mmol/mol [6.5\%]) without glucose-lowering therapy for at least 2~months. Outcome assessors are blinded to group assignment. RESULTS: Of 1510 people invited, 423 (28\%) accepted; of whom, 306 (72\%) were eligible at screening and gave informed consent. Seven participants were later found to have been randomised in error and one withdrew consent, leaving 298 (176 men, 122 women) who will form the intention to treat (ITT) population for analysis. Mean (SD) age was 54.4 (7.6) years, duration of diabetes 3.0 (1.7) years, BMI 34.6 (4.4) kg/m2 for all participants (34.2 (4.2) kg/m2 in men and 35.3 (4.6) kg/m2 in women) and baseline HbA1c (on treatment) 59.3 (12.7) mmol/mol (7.6\% [1.2\%]). The recruitment rate in the intervention and control groups, and comparisons between the subgroups recruited in Scotland and England, showed few differences. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: DiRECT has recruited a cohort of people with type 2 diabetes with characteristics similar to those seen in routine practice, indicating potential widespread applicability. Over 25\% of the eligible population wished to participate in the study, including a high proportion of men, in line with the prevalence distribution of type 2 diabetes.

  abstract = {Excess intra-abdominal adipose tissue accumulation, often termed visceral obesity, is part of a phenotype including dysfunctional subcutaneous adipose tissue expansion and ectopic triglyceride storage closely related to clustering cardiometabolic risk factors. Hypertriglyceridemia; increased free fatty acid availability; adipose tissue release of proinflammatory cytokines; liver insulin resistance and inflammation; increased liver VLDL synthesis and secretion; reduced clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; presence of small, dense LDL particles; and reduced HDL cholesterol levels are among the many metabolic alterations closely related to this condition. Age, gender, genetics, and ethnicity are broad etiological factors contributing to variation in visceral adipose tissue accumulation. Specific mechanisms responsible for proportionally increased visceral fat storage when facing positive energy balance and weight gain may involve sex hormones, local cortisol production in abdominal adipose tissues, endocannabinoids, growth hormone, and dietary fructose. Physiological characteristics of abdominal adipose tissues such as adipocyte size and number, lipolytic responsiveness, lipid storage capacity, and inflammatory cytokine production are significant correlates and even possible determinants of the increased cardiometabolic risk associated with visceral obesity. Thiazolidinediones, estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women, and testosterone replacement in androgen-deficient men have been shown to favorably modulate body fat distribution and cardiometabolic risk to various degrees. However, some of these therapies must now be considered in the context of their serious side effects. Lifestyle interventions leading to weight loss generally induce preferential mobilization of visceral fat. In clinical practice, measuring waist circumference in addition to the body mass index could be helpful for the identification and management of a subgroup of overweight or obese patients at high cardiometabolic risk.},

  abstract = {Bias due to unobserved confounding can seldom be ruled out with certainty when estimating the causal effect of a nonrandomized treatment. The instrumental variable (IV) design offers, under certain assumptions, the opportunity to tame confounding bias, without directly observing all confounders. The IV approach is very well developed in the context of linear regression and also for certain generalized linear models with a nonlinear link function. However, IV methods are not as well developed for regression analysis with a censored survival outcome. In this article, we develop the IV approach for regression analysis in a survival context, primarily under an additive hazards model, for which we describe 2 simple methods for estimating causal effects. The first method is a straightforward 2-stage regression approach analogous to 2-stage least squares commonly used for IV analysis in linear regression. In this approach, the fitted value from a first-stage regression of the exposure on the IV is entered in place of the exposure in the second-stage hazard model to recover a valid estimate of the treatment effect of interest. The second method is a so-called control function approach, which entails adding to the additive hazards outcome model, the residual from a first-stage regression of the exposure on the IV. Formal conditions are given justifying each strategy, and the methods are illustrated in a novel application to a Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the effect of diabetes on mortality using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We also establish that analogous strategies can also be used under a proportional hazards model specification, provided the outcome is rare over the entire follow-up.},

We identified cis-QTLs for the expression of 17,233 genes and 29,514 splicing events (in 6,853 genes). Colocalization analyses revealed 3,430 proteomic and metabolomic traits with a shared association signal with either gene expression or splicing. We quantified the relative contribution of the genetic effects at loci with shared etiology, observing 222 molecular phenotypes significantly mediated by gene expression or splicing. We uncovered gene-regulatory mechanisms at disease loci with therapeutic implications, such as WARS1 in hypertension, IL7R in dermatitis and IFNAR2 in COVID-19.

Early findings, however, revealed a more complex genetic architecture than was anticipated for most common diseases --- complexity that seemed to limit the immediate utility of these findings. As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information. Nevertheless, recent efforts have begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify groups of individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease. In this context, we review the evidence supporting the personal and clinical utility of polygenic risk profiling.},

The results were similar in sensitivity analyses stratified by diabetes or obesity status.In this genetic association study, higher GLP1R gene expression was associated with a small reduction in risk of kidney disease progression.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to assess the association between abdominal obesity and risk of all-cause mortality in patients with HFpEF. METHODS: The present study used data from the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We analyzed and compared the hazard ratios (HRs) in patients with abdominal obesity and those without abdominal obesity using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference of~{$\geq$}102~cm in men and~{$\geq$}88~cm in women. RESULTS: The present study included 3,310 patients with HFpEF: 2,413 patients with abdominal obesity and 897 without abdominal obesity. The mean follow-up was 3.4 {\textpm} 1.7 years. During follow-up, 500 patients died. All-cause mortality rates in patients with and without abdominal obesity were 46.1 and 40.7 events per 1,000 person-years, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients with abdominal obesity than in those without abdominal obesity (adjusted HR: 1.52; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16 to 1.99; p~=~0.002). The risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality was also significantly higher in patients with abdominal obesity than in those without abdominal obesity (adjusted HR: 1.50; 95\% CI: 1.08 to 2.08; p~=~0.01 and adjusted HR: 1.58; 95\% CI: 1.00 to 2.51; p~=~0.04, respectively).

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, yet its relationship with LV size and function is poorly understood. METHODS: A total of 5,098 participants (age 45 to 84 years; 48\% men) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who were free of clinically apparent cardiovascular disease underwent cardiac magnetic resonance to assess LV size and function as well as measures of obesity, including body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference, and cardiovascular risk factors. Fat mass (FM) was estimated based on height-weight models derived from bioelectrical impedance studies. The associations of obesity measures with LV size and function were evaluated using linear spline regression models for body mass index and multivariable regression models for other measures of obesity; they were displayed graphically using generalized additive models. RESULTS: LV mass and end-diastolic volume were positively associated with measures of obesity in both sexes after adjustment for risk factors (e.g., 5.7-g and 6.9-g increase in LV mass per 10-kg increase in FM in women and men, respectively [p {$<$} 0.001]). LV mass-to-volume ratio was positively associated with increased body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, and estimated FM (e.g., 0.02-g/ml and 0.06-g/ml increase in mass-to-volume ratio per 10-kg increase in FM in women and men, respectively [p {$<$} 0.001]). The increased mass-to-volume ratio was due to a greater increase in LV mass relative to LV end-diastolic volume. All associations were stronger for men than for women. Ejection fraction showed no significant association with measures of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was associated with concentric LV remodeling without change in ejection fraction in a large, multiethnic cohort study.},

Obesity is a well-established independent risk factor for development of many cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including heart failure, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. Therefore, it is logical to expect obesity would have a strong correlation with CVD mortality. However, a substantial body of literature demonstrates a paradox with improved prognosis of overweight and obese patients with established CVD compared to lean patients with the identical CVD. Surprisingly, similar data has also shown that cardiovascular fitness, rather than weight loss alone, influences the relationship between obesity and mortality in those with established CVD. The impact of fitness, exercise, physical activity (PA), and weight loss and their relationship to the obesity paradox are all reviewed here.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: An obesity paradox, a "paradoxical" decrease in morbidity and mortality with increasing body mass index (BMI), has been shown in patients with heart failure and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, whether this phenomenon exists in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease is not known. METHODS: A total of 22,576 hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease (follow-up 61,835 patient years, mean age 66+/-9.8 years) were randomized to a verapamil-SR or atenolol strategy. Dose titration and additional drugs (trandolapril and/or hydrochlorothiazide) were added to achieve target blood pressure control according to the Sixth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure targets. Patients were classified into 5 groups according to baseline BMI: less than 20 kg/m2 (thin), 20 to 25 kg/m2 (normal weight), 25 to 30 kg/m2 (overweight), 30 to 35 kg/m2 (class I obesity), and 35 kg/m2 or more (class II-III obesity). The primary outcome was first occurrence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. RESULTS: With patients of normal weight (BMI 20 to{$<$}25 kg/m2) as the reference group, the risk of primary outcome was lower in the overweight patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.86, P{$<$}.001), class I obese patients (adjusted HR 0.68, 95\% CI, 0.59-0.78, P{$<$}.001), and class II to III obese patients (adjusted HR 0.76, 95\% CI, 0.65-0.88, P {$<$}.001). Class I obese patients had the lowest rate of primary outcome and death despite having smaller blood pressure reduction compared with patients of normal weight at 24 months (-17.5+/-21.9 mm Hg/-9.8+/-12.4 mm Hg vs -20.7+/-23.1 mm Hg /-10.6+/-12.5 mm Hg, P{$<$}.001). CONCLUSION: In a population with hypertension and coronary artery disease, overweight and obese patients had a decreased risk of primary outcome compared with patients of normal weight, which was driven primarily by a decreased risk of all-cause mortality. Our results further suggest a protective effect of obesity in patients with known cardiovascular disease in concordance with data in patients with heart failure and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.},

To investigate the HRQoL and their determinants among HF patients with and without comorbidities. Methods and results: TRIUMPH (TRanslational Initiative on Unique and novel strategies for Management of Patients with Heart failure) is a Dutch prospective, multicentre study enrolling 496 acute HF patients between 2009 and 2014. We included 334 patients who had completed the HRQoL questionnaires at baseline. The HRQoL was measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) en EuroQuality-of-life five Dimensions (EQ-5D). Comorbidity was defined as having a history of at least one of the following comorbidities: chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and/or cerebrovascular accident. Patients with comorbidity (n = 205, 61\%) had lower scores on the physical limitation scale and clinical summary score of the KCCQ (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively). Female sex, COPD, previous HF, increasing body mass index (BMI), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high systolic blood pressure, and the presence of anxiety and/or depression negatively influenced the HRQoL among HF patients with comorbidity. Besides anxiety and depression, we hardly found any other determinant of HRQoL in patients without comorbidity. Conclusion: Heart failure patients without comorbidity had better HRQoL than patients with comorbidity. Sex, previous HF, BMI, COPD, systolic blood pressure, NT-proBNP levels, and also anxiety and depression were determinants of HRQoL in patients with comorbidity. In those without comorbidity, apart from anxiety and depression, no further determinants of HRQoL were found.},

  abstract = {Background Lifestyle factors may be important targets in the prevention of heart failure. The current knowledge on the relationship between lifestyle factors and heart failure originates mostly from observational studies. The objective of this study was to investigate causal associations of multiple lifestyle factors with heart failure risk by using Mendelian randomization. Methods We obtained summary statistics data for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the following 5 lifestyle factors at genome-wide significance in genome-wide association studies of European-descent individuals: smoking, alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, physical activity, and sleep duration. The corresponding data for heart failure were acquired from a genome-wide association study comprising 47,309 cases and 930,014 controls of European ancestry. For the primary analyses, we used the inverse-variance weighted method. Results Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation (ever smoked regularly) was robustly associated with a higher odds of heart failure (odds ratio: 1.28; 99\% CI: 1.21-1.35). Genetically predicted longer sleep duration was associated with a lower odds of heart failure (odds ratio per hour/day: 0.73; 99\% CI: 0.60-0.89). We found no associations of alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, and physical activity with heart failure. Conclusions This Mendelian randomization study showed that smoking initiation increases heart failure risk, whereas longer sleep duration decreases the risk of heart failure. Sleep duration should be regarded as novel risk factor in heart failure prevention guidelines. The potential causal role of alcohol and coffee consumption and physical activity for heart failure warrants further investigation in future larger Mendelian randomization analyses.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Obesity is a global health problem, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, often due to cardiovascular (CV) diseases. While bariatric surgery is increasingly performed in patients with obesity and reduces CV risk factors, its effect on CV disease is not established. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on CV outcomes, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed and Embase were searched for literature until August 2021 which compared bariatric surgery patients to non-surgical controls. Outcomes of interest were all-cause and CV mortality, atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction, and stroke. We included 39 studies, all prospective or retrospective cohort studies, but randomized outcome trials were not available. Bariatric surgery was associated with a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality [pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.55; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.62, P {$<$} 0.001 vs. controls], and CV mortality (HR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.47-0.73, P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, bariatric surgery was also associated with a reduced incidence of HF (HR 0.50, 95\% CI 0.38-0.66, P {$<$} 0.001), myocardial infarction (HR 0.58, 95\% CI 0.43-0.76, P {$<$} 0.001), and stroke (HR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.53-0.77, P {$<$} 0.001), while its association with AF was not statistically significant (HR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.64-1.06, P = 0.12). CONCLUSION: The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is associated with reduced all-cause and CV mortality, and lowered incidence of several CV diseases in patients with obesity. Bariatric surgery should therefore be considered in these patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether body mass index (BMI) has a differential impact on survival for females versus males with advanced systolic heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: Females have a survival advantage in HF, the mechanisms of which are unclear. There is also a proposed "obesity survival paradox" in which excess adiposity promotes HF survival. METHODS: We reviewed 3,811 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction~{$\leq$}40\% who had undergone cardiopulmonary exercise testing between 1995 and 2011. The endpoint was all-cause mortality. Multivariable analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Because of the nonlinearity of BMI, a restricted cubic spline was used. An interaction term was added to investigate the impact of BMI on mortality by sex. RESULTS: The unadjusted data demonstrated an overall obesity survival paradox in HF. This survival paradox disappeared for males after adjustment for potential confounders, with overweight and obese males showing higher adjusted mortality hazard ratios compared with normal weight males. Conversely, females in the overweight BMI range (25.0 to 29.9 kg/m(2)) had the lowest adjusted mortality (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95\% confidence interval: 0.77 to 0.93; p~= 0.0005 compared with normal weight females) with a nadir in mortality hazard just below BMI 30 kg/m(2). The multivariable model supported a differential impact of BMI on mortality in males versus females (p for interaction~{$<$}0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this advanced HF cohort, an unadjusted obesity survival paradox disappeared after adjustment for confounders. Overweight and obese males had higher adjusted mortality than normal weight males, whereas a BMI in the overweight range was associated with a significant survival benefit in females.},

  abstract = {The "obesity paradox" has been reported in several observational studies, where obesity was shown to be associated to a decreased mortality in individuals suffering from a chronic disease, such as diabetes or heart failure. Causal arguments have recently been given to explain this apparently paradoxical fact: because the chronic disease is caused by obesity, the observed "protective effect" of obesity among patients with, say, diabetes, actually has no causal value. Recently, Sperrin et al. (2016) relaunched the debate and claimed that the resulting bias, the so-called collider bias, was unlikely to be the main explanation for the obesity paradox. However, a number of issues in their work make their conclusions questionable. In this article, we first study the bias between (i) the association between obesity and early death among patients suffering from the chronic disease \${\textbackslash}Delta\_\{AS\}\$ and (ii) the causal effect considered by Sperrin et al. Under the usual framework of structural causal models, we explain why this bias can be much higher than what these authors reported. We further consider alternative causal effects of potential interest and study their difference with \${\textbackslash}Delta\_\{AS\}\$. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the magnitude of these differences under realistic scenarios. We show that it is possible to have a negative \${\textbackslash}Delta\_\{AS\}\$, while the causal effects we considered are all positive. Therefore, even under the very simple generative model we considered, collider bias can be the sole cause of the obesity paradox.},

Angiotensin-converting enzyme concentration was determined by additive genes for 43\% of its variance, by shared environmental influences for 42\%, and by specific environmental influences for 15\%. The high heritability found for AGT is compatible with the results of earlier studies linking the M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene to plasma AGT levels. For PRA, we are the first to show significant heritability. Our results regarding ACE confirm the findings in other populations.},

Given the extensive heterogeneity among patients with heart failure, substantial differences in the response to therapy can be expected. We hypothesize that individualized therapy is an essential next step to improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. Methods: The BIOlogy Study to TAilored Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure (BIOSTAT-CHF) included 2516 patients with worsening signs and/or symptoms of heart failure from 11 European countries, who were considered to be on suboptimal medical treatment. Another 1738 patients from Scotland were included in a validation cohort. Overall, both patient cohorts were well matched. The majority of patients were hospitalized for acute heart failure, and the remainder presented with worsening signs and/or symptoms of heart failure at outpatient clinics. Approximately half of the patients were in New York Heart Association class III, and 7\% vs 34\% of patients of the index vs validation cohort had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. According to study design, all patients used diuretics, but owing to the inclusion criteria of both cohorts, patients were not on optimal, evidence-based medical therapy. In the follow-up phase, uptitration to guideline-recommended doses was encouraged. Conclusion: By using a novel systems biology approach, incorporating demographics, biomarkers, genome-wide analysis, and proteomics, a model that predicts response to therapy will be developed, which should be instrumental in developing alternative therapies for patients with suboptimal response to currently recommended therapies and thus further improve care for patients with heart failure.},

Results MR analyses supported a causal association between higher BMI and greater risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 kg/m2: 1.03; 95\% CI: 0.99-1.07) and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (HR: 1.10; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.19), specifically coronary heart disease (HR: 1.12; 95\% CI: 1.00-1.25) and those excluding coronary heart disease/stroke/aortic aneurysm (HR: 1.24; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.48), stomach cancer (HR: 1.18; 95\% CI: 0.87-1.62), and esophageal cancer (HR: 1.22; 95\% CI: 0.98-1.53), and a decreased risk of lung cancer mortality (HR: 0.96; 95\% CI: 0.85-1.08). Sex stratification supported the causal role of higher BMI increasing bladder cancer mortality risk (males) but decreasing respiratory disease mortality risk (males). The J-shaped observational association between BMI and mortality was visible with MR analyses, but the BMI at which mortality was minimized was lower and the association was flatter over a larger BMI range. Conclusions Results support a causal role of higher BMI in increasing the risk of all-cause mortality and mortality from several specific causes.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a widely used method that exploits the unique properties of germline genetic variation to strengthen causal inference in relationships between exposures and outcomes. Nonlinear MR allows estimation of the shape of these relationships. In a previous paper, the authors applied linear and nonlinear MR to estimate the effect of BMI on mortality in UK Biobank, providing evidence for a J-shaped association. However, it is now clear that there are problems with widely used nonlinear MR methods, which draws attention to the likely erroneous nature of the conclusions regarding the shapes of several explored relationships. Here, the authors explore the utility and likely biases of these nonlinear MR methods with the use of a negative control design. Although there remains good evidence for a causal effect of higher BMI increasing the risk of mortality, the pattern of this association across different levels of BMI requires further characterization.},

  abstract = {Analyses of data from genome-wide association studies on unrelated individuals have shown that, for human traits and diseases, approximately one-third to two-thirds of heritability is captured by common SNPs. However, it is not known whether the remaining heritability is due to the imperfect tagging of causal variants by common SNPs, in particular whether the causal variants are rare, or whether it is overestimated due to bias in inference from pedigree data. Here we estimated heritability for height and body mass index (BMI) from whole-genome sequence data on 25,465 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. The estimated heritability was 0.68 (standard error 0.10) for height and 0.30 (standard error 0.10) for body mass index. Low minor allele frequency variants in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) with neighboring variants were enriched for heritability, to a greater extent for protein-altering variants, consistent with negative selection. Our results imply that rare variants, in particular those in regions of low linkage disequilibrium, are a major source of the still missing heritability of complex traits and disease.},

To avoid this, it is useful to know the relationship between the relative risk of a disease or disorder in people with high and low values of a risk factor, and the equivalent screening performance in terms of the detection rate (sensitivity) for a specified false-positive rate. We describe an interactive Risk-Screening Converter, accessible from the Internet (http://www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/rsc/), that transforms an odds ratio into the equivalent estimates of detection and false-positive rates. The converter is intended for general clinicians, for people engaged in research into risk factors and disease, and for those who give advice on applying such research findings into medical practice. It should help to distinguish effective screening methods from ineffective ones, and so improve clinical guidelines relating to screening and the prediction and prevention of disease.},

However, there is notable heterogeneity in the application and reporting of these risk scores, which hinders the translation of PRSs into clinical care. Here, in a collaboration between the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Complex Disease Working Group and the Polygenic Score (PGS) Catalog, we present the Polygenic Risk Score Reporting Standards (PRS-RS), in which we update the Genetic Risk Prediction Studies (GRIPS) Statement to reflect the present state of the field. Drawing on the input of experts in epidemiology, statistics, disease-specific applications, implementation and policy, this comprehensive reporting framework defines the minimal information that is needed to interpret and evaluate PRSs, especially with respect to downstream clinical applications. Items span detailed descriptions of study populations, statistical methods for the development and validation of PRSs and considerations for the potential limitations of these scores. In addition, we emphasize the need for data availability and transparency, and we encourage researchers to deposit and share PRSs through the PGS Catalog to facilitate reproducibility and comparative benchmarking. By providing these criteria in a structured format that builds on existing standards and ontologies, the use of this framework in publishing PRSs will facilitate translation into clinical care and progress towards defining best practice.},

One of the mechanisms believed to be responsible for this phenomenon is increased systemic and cerebral angiotensin II signaling. Plasma angiotensin II is increased in humans and animals with chronic heart failure. The increase in angiotensin II signaling enhances sympathetic nerve activity through actions on both central and peripheral sites during chronic heart failure. Angiotensin II signaling is enhanced in different brain sites such as the paraventricular nucleus, the rostral ventrolateral medulla and the area postrema. Blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptors decreases sympathetic nerve activity and cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex when therapy is administered to the paraventricular nucleus. Injection of an angiotensin receptor blocker into the area postrema activates the sympathoinhibitory baroreflex. In peripheral regions, angiotensin II elevates both norepinephrine release and synthesis and inhibits norepinephrine uptake at nerve endings, which may contribute to the increase in sympathetic nerve activity seen in chronic heart failure. Increased circulating angiotensin II during chronic heart failure may enhance the sympathoexcitatory chemoreflex and inhibit the sympathoinhibitory baroreflex. In addition, increased circulating angiotensin II can directly act on the central nervous system via the subfornical organ and the area postrema to increase sympathetic outflow. Inhibition of angiotensin II formation and its type 1 receptor has been shown to have beneficial effects in chronic heart failure patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Growing evidence have demonstrated that thyroid hormones have been involved in the processes of cardiovascular metabolism. However, the causal relationship of thyroid function and cardiometabolic health remains partly unknown. METHODS The Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to test genetic, potentially causal relationships between instrumental variables and cardiometabolic traits. Genetic variants of free thyroxine (FT4) and thyrotropin (TSH) levels within the reference range were used as instrumental variables. Data for genetic associations with cardiometabolic diseases were acquired from the genome-wide association studies of the FinnGen, CARDIoGRAM and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, CHARGE, and MEGASTROKE. This study was conducted using summary statistic data from large, previously described cohorts. Association between thyroid function and essential hypertension (EHTN), secondary hypertension (SHTN), hyperlipidemia (HPL), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), ischemic heart disease (IHD), myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), pulmonary heart disease (PHD), stroke, and non-rheumatic valve disease (NRVD) were examined. RESULTS Genetically predicted FT4 levels were associated with SHTN (odds ratio = 0.48; 95\% CI = 0.04-0.82,P = 0.027), HPL (odds ratio = 0.67; 95\% CI = 0.18-0.88,P = 0.023), T2DM (odds ratio = 0.80; 95\% CI = 0.42-0.86,P = 0.005), IHD (odds ratio = 0.85; 95\% CI = 0.49-0.98,P = 0.039), NRVD (odds ratio = 0.75; 95\% CI = 0.27-0.97,P = 0.039). Additionally, genetically predicted TSH levels were associated with HF (odds ratio = 0.82; 95\% CI = 0.68-0.99,P = 0.042), PHD (odds ratio = 0.75; 95\% CI = 0.32-0.82,P = 0.006), stroke (odds ratio = 0.95; 95\% CI = 0.81-0.97,P = 0.007). However, genetically predicted thyroid function traits were not associated with EHTN and MI. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests FT4 and TSH are associated with cardiometabolic diseases, underscoring the importance of the pituitary-thyroid-cardiac axis in cardiometabolic health susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Objectives The association between obesity and prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) remains uncertain. We undertook a meta-analysis for the effects of body mass index (BMI) on mortality and cardiovascular events in these patients. Methods We identified studies that provided risk estimates for mortality or cardiovascular events on the basis of BMI in patients with CAD. Summary estimates of relative risks were obtained for five BMI groups: underweight, normal-weight, overweight, obese and grade II/III obese. Mortality was analysed separately as short-term ({$<$}6 months) and long-term ({$\geq$}6 months). Results Data from 89 studies with 1 300 794 patients were included. Mean follow-up of long-term estimates was 3.2 years. Using normal-weight as the reference, underweight was associated with higher risk of short-term mortality (2.24 (1.85 to 2.72)) and long-term mortality (1.70 (1.56 to 1.86)), overweight and obesity were both associated with lower risk of short-term mortality (0.69 (0.64 to 0.75); 0.68 (0.61 to 0.75)) and long-term mortality (0.78 (0.74 to 0.82); 0.79 (0.73 to 0.85)), but the long-term benefit of obesity disappeared after 5 years of follow-up (0.99 (0.91 to 1.08)). Grade II/III obesity was associated with lower risk of mortality in the short term (0.76 (0.62 to 0.91)) but higher risk after 5 years of follow-up (1.25 (1.14 to 1.38)). The similar J-shaped pattern was also seen for cardiovascular mortality and across different treatment strategies. Meta-regression found an attenuation of the inverse association between BMI and risk of mortality over longer follow-up. Conclusions Our data support a J-shaped relationship between mortality and BMI in patients with CAD. The limitation of current literature warrants better design of future studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanisms linking obesity to hypertension have not been established, but sodium retention and excessive sympathetic tone are key contributors. The natriuretic peptides are important regulators of sodium homeostasis and neurohormonal activation, raising the possibility that obese individuals have an impaired natriuretic peptide response. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the relations of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide (N-ANP) to body mass index in 3389 Framingham Study participants (1803 women) without heart failure. Multivariable regression analyses were performed, adjusting for clinical and echocardiographic covariates. BNP levels below the assay detection limit and N-ANP levels in the lowest sex-specific quartile were categorized as low. Multivariable-adjusted mean plasma BNP levels in lean ({$<$}25 kg/m2), overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2), and obese ({$>$} or =30 kg/m2) men were 21.4, 15.5, and 12.7 pg/mL, respectively (trend P{$<$}0.0001). Corresponding values in women were 21.1, 16.3, and 13.1 pg/mL (trend P{$<$}0.001). A similar pattern was noted for plasma N-ANP. Obese individuals had higher odds of having low plasma BNP (multivariable-adjusted odds ratios: men, 2.51; 95\% CI, 1.71 to 3.68; women, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.32 to 2.58) and low plasma N-ANP (odds ratios: men, 4.81; 95\% CI, 2.98 to 7.76; women, 2.85; 95\% CI, 2.01 to 4.04) compared with lean individuals. Diabetes also was associated with low plasma natriuretic peptide levels, and the negative effects of obesity and diabetes on natriuretic peptide levels were additive. CONCLUSIONS: Obese individuals have low circulating natriuretic peptide levels, which may contribute to their susceptibility to hypertension and hypertension-related disorders.},

Little is known about the current situation of elevated blood pressure in the United States, according to the new guidelines. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of national representative data collected from 4805 adults 18 years and older surveyed in the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We examined the prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension according to the new JNC guidelines, people's awareness and management of hypertension, and the differences across sociodemographic and body weight groups. RESULTS: Elevated blood pressure is a serious problem in the United States. Approximately 60\% of American adults have prehypertension or hypertension, and some population groups, such as African Americans, older people, low-socioeconomic-status groups, and overweight groups, are disproportionately affected. The prevalence of hypertension has increased by approximately 10 percentage points during the past decade. The awareness and appropriate management of hypertension among hypertensive patients remain low: 31\% were not aware of their disease, only two thirds (66\%) were told by health professionals to adopt lifestyle modifications or take drugs to control hypertension, and only 31\% controlled their hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: With 60\% of the population affected, the United States is facing a serious challenge in the prevention and management of prehypertension and hypertension. People's awareness and control of hypertension remain poor. This study highlights the seriousness of the problem and the importance of promoting lifestyle modifications.},

This study aims to investigate the effects of PDCD4 on obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Surprisingly, high-fat diet (HFD)-fed PDCD4-deficient (PDCD4(-/-)) mice exhibited an absolutely lean phenotype together with improved insulin sensitivity. Compared with wild-type obese mice, HFD-fed PDCD4(-/-) mice showed higher energy expenditure, lower epididymal fat weight, and reduced macrophage infiltration inflammatory cytokine secretion in white adipose tissue (WAT). Alleviated hepatic steatosis along with decreased plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol was also observed in these mice. Importantly, PDCD4 appeared to disturb lipid metabolism via inhibiting the expression of liver X receptor (LXR)-{$\alpha$}, a master modulator of lipid homeostasis, which was elevated in HFD-fed PDCD4(-/-) mice accompanied by upregulation of its target genes and relieved endoplasmic reticulum stress in WAT. These data demonstrate that PDCD4 deficiency protects mice against diet-induced obesity, WAT inflammation, and insulin resistance through restoring the expression of LXR-{$\alpha$}, thereby proposing PDCD4 as a potential target for treating obesity-associated diseases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and incident HF in men with and without pre-existing coronary heart disease (CHD) and assessed the contribution of plasma leptin concentration to these associations. BACKGROUND: Leptin has been proposed as a potential link between obesity and heart failure (HF). METHODS: This was a prospective study of 4,080 men age 60 to 79 years with no diagnosed HF followed for a mean period of 9 years, in whom there were 228 incident HF cases. RESULTS: Increased BMI was associated with significantly increased risk of HF in men with and without pre-existing CHD (myocardial infarction or angina) after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors including C-reactive protein. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) associated with a 1-SD increase in BMI were 1.37 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09 to 1.72) and 1.18 (95\% CI: 1.00 to 1.39) in men with and without CHD, respectively. Increased leptin was significantly associated with an increased risk of HF in men without pre-existing CHD, independent of BMI and potential mediators (adjusted HR for a 1-SD increase in log leptin: 1.30 [95\% CI: 1.06 to 1.61]; p = 0.01). However, no association was seen in those with pre-existing CHD (corresponding HR: 1.06 [95\% CI: 0.77 to 1.45]; p = 0.72). Adjustment for leptin abolished the association between BMI and HF in men with no CHD; in those with CHD, the association between BMI and HF remained significant (p = 0.03). Similar patterns were seen for waist circumference. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of established CHD, the association between obesity and HF may be mediated by plasma leptin. In those with CHD, obesity appears to increase the risk of HF independent of leptin.},

  abstract = {Objective: We sought to assess the effects on cerebrovascular events of treating patients with stable coronary disease with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels substantially below 100 mg/dl. Background: Lowering LDL-C with statins has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with stable coronary disease. In observational studies, naturally low cholesterol levels have been associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The cerebrovascular benefits of treating patients with stable coronary disease to LDL-C levels substantially below 100 mg/dl have not been previously investigated. Methods: We describe an analysis of cerebrovascular events in the Treating to New Targets study, a trial where 10,001 patients with documented coronary disease were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin at 10 mg/day or 80 mg/day and followed for a median of 4.9 years. Results: Mean LDL-C levels were 101 mg/dl on 10 mg atorvastatin and 77 mg/dl on 80 mg. In addition to the reduction in major cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 0.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.69 to 0.89; p = 0.0002), the primary end point of the trial, patients in the 80-mg arm experienced a reduction in cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio 0.77, 95\% CI 0.64 to 0.93; p = 0.007) and stroke (hazard ratio 0.75, 95\% CI 0.59 to 0.96; p = 0.02). Each 1-mg/dl reduction in LDL-C with treatment was associated with a 0.6\% relative risk reduction in cerebrovascular events (p = 0.002) and a 0.5\% relative risk reduction in stroke (p = 0.041). The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was similar in the 80-mg and 10-mg groups, 16 and 18 respectively, and the hemorrhagic strokes were distributed evenly across quintiles of achieved LDL-C during treatment. Conclusions: Among patients with established coronary disease, treating to an LDL-cholesterol substantially below 100 mg/dl with 80 mg/day atorvastatin reduces both stroke and cerebrovascular events by an additional 20\% to 25\% compared with the 10 mg/day dose. An increase in hemorrhagic stroke was not seen at low LDL-C levels.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify endotypes of osteoarthritis (OA) by a metabolomics analysis. METHODS: Study participants included hip/knee OA patients and controls. Fasting plasma samples were metabolomically profiled. Common factor analysis and K-means clustering were applied to the metabolomics data to identify the endotypes of OA patients. Logistic regression was utilized to identify the most significant metabolites contributing to the endotypes. Clinical and epidemiological factors were examined in relation to the identified OA endotypes. RESULTS: Six hundred and fifteen primary OA patients and 237 controls were included. Among the 186 metabolites measured, 162 passed the quality control analysis. The 615 OA patients were classified in three clusters (A, 66; B, 200; and C, 349). Patients in cluster A had a significantly higher concentration of butyrylcarnitine (C4) than other clusters and controls (all P\,{$<$}\,0.0002). Elevated C4 is thought to be related to muscle weakness and wasting. Patients in cluster B had a significantly lower arginine concentration than other clusters and controls (all P\,{$<$}\,7.98\,{\texttimes}\,10-11). Cluster C patients had a significantly lower concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine (with palmitic acid), which is a pro-inflammatory bioactive compound, than other clusters and controls (P\,{$<$}\,3.79\,{\texttimes}\,10-6). Further, cluster A had a higher BMI and prevalence of diabetes than other clusters (all P\,{$\leq$}\,0.0009), and also a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease than cluster C (P\,=\,0.04). Cluster B had a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease than cluster C (P\,=\,0.003) whereas cluster C had a higher prevalence of osteoporosis (P\,=\,0.009). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest three possible clinically actionable endotypes in primary OA: muscle weakness, arginine deficit and low inflammatory OA.},

Among genes with sex-biased expression, we found 67\% concordance between sex-differentiated protein and transcript levels; however, sex effects on the genetic regulation of expression were more evident at the protein level. Considering 24 psychiatric, neurologic and brain morphologic traits, we found that an average of 25\% of their putatively causal genes had sex-differentiated protein abundance and 12 putatively causal proteins had sb-pQTLs. Furthermore, integrating sex-specific pQTLs with sex-stratified genome-wide association studies of six psychiatric and neurologic conditions, we uncovered another 23 proteins contributing to these traits in one sex but not the other. Together, these findings begin to provide insights into mechanisms underlying sex differences in brain protein expression and disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular safety profile of dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 that promotes glucosuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, is undefined. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to receive either dapagliflozin or placebo. The primary safety outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. The primary efficacy outcomes were MACE and a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary efficacy outcomes were a renal composite ({$\geq$}40\% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate to {$<$}60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, new end-stage renal disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes) and death from any cause. RESULTS: We evaluated 17,160 patients, including 10,186 without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who were followed for a median of 4.2 years. In the primary safety outcome analysis, dapagliflozin met the prespecified criterion for noninferiority to placebo with respect to MACE (upper boundary of the 95\% confidence interval [CI], {$<$}1.3; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority). In the two primary efficacy analyses, dapagliflozin did not result in a lower rate of MACE (8.8\% in the dapagliflozin group and 9.4\% in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.84 to 1.03; P=0.17) but did result in a lower rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (4.9\% vs. 5.8\%; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P=0.005), which reflected a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.61 to 0.88); there was no between-group difference in cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.17). A renal event occurred in 4.3\% in the dapagliflozin group and in 5.6\% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.87), and death from any cause occurred in 6.2\% and 6.6\%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.04). Diabetic ketoacidosis was more common with dapagliflozin than with placebo (0.3\% vs. 0.1\%, P=0.02), as was the rate of genital infections that led to discontinuation of the regimen or that were considered to be serious adverse events (0.9\% vs. 0.1\%, P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, treatment with dapagliflozin did not result in a higher or lower rate of MACE than placebo but did result in a lower rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, a finding that reflects a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure.

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) makes causal claims by treating genetic variation in an analogous way to randomization in a clinical trial. MR investigations can be viewed as analogous to a randomized encouragement design, in that genetic variants do not determine the precise level of an exposure, but increase liability to it. As such, an MR estimate typically does not represent an achievable or well-defined causal effect in terms of the exposure, as it reflects the impact of a life-long shift in the trajectory of the exposure, which likely differs between individuals. We advocate for MR investigations to be performed to assess evidence for a causal hypothesis, rather than to estimate a well-defined causal quantity. MR estimates are useful to combine evidence across genetic variants, to assess the validity of variants as instruments, to provide confidence intervals, and to compare estimates across outcomes. However, numerical estimates from MR should not be over-interpreted. The value of an MR investigation is not to quantify the magnitude of effect for a well-defined intervention in the exposure. Instead, it provides a distinct source of evidence to increase or decrease confidence in a causal hypothesis, which can be triangulated with evidence from other sources.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative nervous system disease. At present, there are certain limitations in various treatment options aimed at preventing or delaying the progression of PD. Therefore, the exploration of new drugs for PD is beneficial. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis can be used to explore the association between drugs and diseases. In this study, MR analysis was adopted to investigate the causal relationship between 23 drugs and PD. These drugs have been approved for the treatment of different diseases, such as salicylic acid and derivatives (collectively called salicylates, e.g., aspirin, used for fever and pain relief), antithrombotic agents (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, used for preventing thrombotic events). METHODS: The GWAS data for the 23 drugs were obtained from the UK Biobank (UKB) project, while the GWAS data for PD were sourced from FinnGen. Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs). We first performed a series of quality control steps (including MR-PRESSO) to select the appropriate SNPs. Two-sample MR analysis was performed using five different methods, including inverse variance weighting (IVW) with random-effects model, weighted median, MR-Egger, simple model, and weighted model. At the same time, sensitivity analysis was carried out using the MR-Egger and Cochran's Q test to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the results. RESULTS: In MR-PRESSO, salicylates and antithrombotic agents showed statistically significant associations with PD, respectively. In the main MR analysis (IVW), there was a negative causal relationship between salicylates and PD (OR~=~0.73, 95\% CI~=~0.54-0.98, p~=~.039). Similarly, there was a negative causal relationship between antithrombotic agents and PD (OR~=~0.70, 95\%CI~=~0.52-0.96, p~=~.027). No statistically significant association was found between the remaining 21 drugs and PD. CONCLUSION: This MR study demonstrated that salicylates and antithrombotic agents can reduce the risk of PD, thus providing a novel avenue for future drug exploration in PD.},

  abstract = {Recent genetic studies have identified some alleles that are associated with higher BMI but lower risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. These "favorable adiposity" alleles are collectively associated with lower insulin levels and higher subcutaneous-to-visceral adipose tissue ratio and may protect from disease through higher adipose storage capacity. We aimed to use data from 164,609 individuals from the UK Biobank and five other studies to replicate associations between a genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants and adiposity and risk of disease, to test for interactions between BMI and favorable adiposity genetics, and to test effects separately in men and women. In the UK Biobank, the 50\% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles had higher BMIs (0.120 kg/m(2) [95\% CI 0.066, 0.174]; P = 1E-5) and higher body fat percentage (0.301\% [0.230, 0.372]; P = 1E-16) compared with the 50\% of individuals carrying the fewest alleles. For a given BMI, the 50\% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles were at lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.837 [0.784, 0.894]; P = 1E-7), hypertension (OR 0.935 [0.911, 0.958]; P = 1E-7), and heart disease (OR 0.921 [0.872, 0.973]; P = 0.003) and had lower blood pressure (systolic -0.859 mmHg [-1.099, -0.618]; P = 3E-12 and diastolic -0.394 mmHg [-0.534, -0.254]; P = 4E-8). In women, these associations could be explained by the observation that the alleles associated with higher BMI but lower risk of disease were also associated with a favorable body fat distribution, with a lower waist-to-hip ratio (-0.004 cm [95\% CI -0.005, -0.003] 50\% vs. 50\%; P = 3E-14), but in men, the favorable adiposity alleles were associated with higher waist circumference (0.454 cm [0.267, 0.641] 50\% vs. 50\%; P = 2E-6) and higher waist-to-hip ratio (0.0013 [0.0003, 0.0024] 50\% vs. 50\%; P = 0.01). Results were strengthened when a meta-analysis with five additional studies was conducted. There was no evidence of interaction between a genetic score consisting of known BMI variants and the favorable adiposity genetic score. In conclusion, different molecular mechanisms that lead to higher body fat percentage (with greater subcutaneous storage capacity) can have different impacts on cardiometabolic disease risk. Although higher BMI is associated with higher risk of diseases, better fat storage capacity could reduce the risk.},

We aimed to assess the associations of GLP-1R activation with mental health well-being and the risk of mental health disorders and substance use disorders. We performed drug-target Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses using the largest relevant publicly available genome-wide association studies in European ancestry individuals. After correcting for multiple comparisons, genetically predicted lower body mass index (BMI) via GLP-1R activation was associated with a better well-being spectrum (0.06 standard deviation [95\% confidence interval 0.03-0.08]) and lower risk of depression (odds ratio 0.83 [0.74-0.94]) and bipolar disorder (odds ratio 0.61 [0.47-0.79]) per 1-kg/m2 decrease in BMI. There was also suggestive evidence that genetically predicted lower BMI via GLP-1R activation was associated with lower risk of post-partum depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders, and that genetically predicted lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) via GLP-1R activation was associated with higher risk of anorexia nervosa but lower risk of Tourette syndrome. These associations were stronger than the associations for genetically predicted lower BMI and lower HbA1c based on genome-wide variants. The posterior probabilities of a shared causal variant affecting both BMI and the outcome at the GLP1R gene were 59.3\% for the well-being spectrum, 3.8\% for depression, and 45.9\% for bipolar disorder. GLP-1R activation was associated with better mental health well-being and lower risk of depression and bipolar disorder beyond that expected from the reduction in BMI and HbA1c.},

We identified only one locus significantly associated with disease-specific mortality and show that, at a similar sample size, more genome-wide significant loci can be identified in a GWAS of disease susceptibility. Variants that were significantly affecting disease susceptibility were weakly or not associated with disease-specific mortality. Moreover, susceptibility polygenic scores (PGSs) were weak predictor of disease-specific mortality while a PGS for general lifespan was significantly associated with disease-specific mortality for five out of ten diseases. We used theoretical derivation and simulation to propose plausible explanations for our empirical observations and account for potential index-event bias. Overall, our findings point to little similarity in genetic effects between disease susceptibility and disease-specific mortality and suggest that either larger sample sizes or different measures of progression are needed to identify the genetic underpinning of disease progression.},

Here, we perform sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on LVEF and transcriptome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) on LVEF, all-cause HF, HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The sex-stratified GWASs of LVEF identified three sex-specific loci that were exclusively detected in the sex-stratified GWASs. Three drug target genes show sex-differential effects on HF/HFrEF via influencing LVEF, with \emph{NPR2} as the target gene for the HF drug Cenderitide under phase 2 clinical trial. Our study highlights the importance of considering sex-differential genetic effects in sex-balanced diseases such as HF and emphasizes the value of sex-stratified GWASs and MR in identifying putative genetic variants, causal genes, and candidate drug targets for HF, which is not identifiable using a sex-combined strategy.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a serious threat to public health, but its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In screening important genes using Gene Importance Calculator (GIC) we developed previously, ribosomal modification protein rimK-like family member A (RIMKLA) was predicted as one essential gene but its functions remained largely unknown. The current study determined the roles of RIMKLA in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. RIMKLA expression was reduced in livers of human and mouse with NAFLD. Hepatic RIMKLA overexpression ameliorated steatosis and hyperglycemia in obese mice. Hepatocyte-specific RIMKLA knockout aggravated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced dysregulated glucose/lipid metabolism in mice. Mechanistically, RIMKLA is a new protein kinase that phosphorylates betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1 (BHMT1) at threonine 45 (Thr45) site. Upon phosphorylation at Thr45 and activation, BHMT1 eliminated homocysteine (Hcy) to inhibit the activity of transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP1) and its induction on fatty acid synthase (FASn) and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) gene transcriptions, concurrently repressing lipid synthesis and uptake in hepatocytes. Thr45 to alanine (T45A) mutation inactivated BHMT1 to abolish RIMKLA's repression on Hcy level, AP1 activity, FASn/CD36 expressions, and lipid deposition. BHMT1 overexpression rescued the dysregulated lipid metabolism in RIMKLA-deficient hepatocytes. In summary, RIMKLA is a novel protein kinase that phosphorylates BHMT1 at Thr45 to repress lipid synthesis and uptake. Under obese condition, inhibition of RIMKLA impairs BHMT1 activity to promote hepatic lipid deposition.},

Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in {$\sim$}450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N~{$\sim$}700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P~{$<~$}1~{\texttimes}~10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain {$\sim$}24.6\% of the variance of height and {$\sim$}6.0\% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were {$\sim$}0.44 and {$\sim$}0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow-up studies.},

  abstract = {Background PDZK1 is a four PDZ-domain containing protein that binds to the carboxy terminus of the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and regulates its expression, localization and function in a tissue-specific manner. PDZK1 knockout (KO) mice are characterized by a marked reduction of SR-BI protein expression ({$\sim$}95\%) in the liver (lesser or no reduction in other organs) with a concomitant 1.7 fold increase in plasma cholesterol. PDZK1 has been shown to be atheroprotective using the high fat/high cholesterol (`Western') diet-fed murine apolipoprotein E (apoE) KO model of atherosclerosis, presumably because of its role in promoting reverse cholesterol transport via SR-BI. Principal Findings Here, we have examined the effects of PDZK1 deficiency in apoE KO mice fed with the atherogenic `Paigen' diet for three months. Relative to apoE KO, PDZK1/apoE double KO (dKO) mice showed increased plasma lipids (33\% increase in total cholesterol; 49 \% increase in unesterified cholesterol; and 36\% increase in phospholipids) and a 26\% increase in aortic root lesions. Compared to apoE KO, dKO mice exhibited substantial occlusive coronary artery disease: 375\% increase in severe occlusions. Myocardial infarctions, not observed in apoE KO mice (although occasional minimal fibrosis was noted), were seen in 7 of 8 dKO mice, resulting in 12 times greater area of fibrosis in dKO cardiac muscle. Conclusions These results show that Paigen-diet fed PDZK1/apoE dKO mice represent a new animal model useful for studying coronary heart disease and suggest that PDZK1 may represent a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.},

The aim of this study was to explore potential associations between the -2548G/A polymorphism and adiposity-related variables, plasma total leptin levels, as well as soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) levels and free leptin in a group of healthy Greek subjects. One hundred eighteen consecutively enrolled subjects [62 females, 56 males; mean age+/-SD: 17.7+/-1.8 years; body mass index (BMI) range: 15.4-35.9 kg/m2] were genotyped for the -2548G/A polymorphism and their BMI, fat free mass, \% fat mass, fasting plasma total leptin and sOB-R levels were determined. The ratio leptin/sOB-R was used as an index of free leptin. No significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of the -2548G/A polymorphism were detected between normal weight and overweight subjects, and no association was found between this polymorphism and BMI, fat mass or plasma total leptin levels. However, the -2548G/A polymorphism was found to be associated with circulating free leptin levels in a gender specific manner. More specifically, compared to carriers of the -2548G allele, female subjects with the A/A genotype had higher age and fat mass adjusted mean (+/-SE) plasma concentrations of sOB-R (32.9+/-7.2 vs. 25.6+/-3.8 ng/ml, P=0.05), and significantly lower (approx. 50\%) leptin/sOB-R values (0.74+/-0.25 vs. 1.42+/-0.13, P=0.02). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis revealed that, after adjustment to fat mass, the -2548G/A genotype and gender are significantly associated with free leptin index in the entire study sample. Similar regression models revealed a significant interaction of gender and genotype when considered in addition to fat mass, or fat mass and genotype when considered in addition to gender, as predictors of free leptin index. In conclusion, the common -2548G/A promoter variant of the human leptin gene is associated with plasma free leptin levels through an interaction with adiposity and gender in healthy subjects.},

  abstract = {Background-Patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (CHF) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have a high risk of death and hospitalization for CHF deterioration despite therapies with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, {$\beta$}-blockers, and even an aldosterone antagonist. To determine whether the angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan decreases cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, and all-cause mortality in patients with CHF and depressed LVEF, a prespecified analysis of the combined Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) low LVEF trials was performed. CHARM is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international trial program. Methods and Results-New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II through IV CHF patients with an LVEF of {$\leq$}40\% were randomized to candesartan or placebo in 2 complementary parallel trials (CHARM-Alternative, for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors, and CHARM-Added, for patients who were receiving ACE inhibitors). Mortality and morbidity were determined in 4576 low LVEF patients (2289 candesartan and 2287 placebo), titrated as tolerated to a target dose of 32 mg once daily, and observed for 2 to 4 years (median, 40 months). The primary outcome (time to first event by intention to treat) was cardiovascular death or CHF hospitalization for each trial, with all-cause mortality a secondary end point in the pooled analysis of the low LVEF trials. Of the patients in the candesartan group, 817 (35.7\%) experienced cardiovascular death or a CHF hospitalization as compared with 944 (41.3\%) in the placebo group (HR 0.82; 95\% CI 0.74 to 0.90; P{\textexclamdown}0.001) with reduced risk for both cardiovascular deaths (521 [22.8\%] versus 599 [26.2\%]; HR 0.84 [95\% CI 0.75 to 0.95]; P=0.005) and CHF hospitalizations (516 [22.5\%] versus 642 [28.1\%]; HR 0.76 [95\% CI 0.68 to 0.85]; P{\textexclamdown}0.001). It is important to note that all-cause mortality also was significantly reduced by candesartan (642 [28.0\%] versus 708 [31.0\%]; HR 0.88 [95\% CI 0.79 to 0.98]; P=0.018). No significant heterogeneity for the beneficial effects of candesartan was found across prespecified and subsequently identified subgroups including treatment with ACE inhibitors, {$\beta$}-blockers, an aldosterone antagonist, or their combinations. The study drug was discontinued because of adverse effects by 23.1\% of patients in the candesartan group and 18.8\% in the placebo group; the reasons included increased creatinine (7.1\% versus 3.5\%), hypotension (4.2\% versus 2.1\%), and hyperkalemia (2.8\% versus 0.5\%), respectively (all P{\textexclamdown}0.001). Conclusion-Candesartan significantly reduces all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with CHF and LVEF s40\% when added to standard therapies including ACE inhibitors, {$\beta$}-blockers, and an aldosterone antagonist. Routine monitoring of blood pressure, serum creatinine, and serum potassium is warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In heart failure (HF), weight loss (WL) has been associated with an adverse prognosis whereas obesity has been linked to lower mortality (the obesity paradox). The impact of WL in obese patients with HF is incompletely understood. Our objective was to explore the prevalence of WL and its impact on long-term mortality, with an emphasis on obese patients, in a cohort of patients with chronic HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Weight at first visit and the 1-year follow-up and vital status after 3~years were assessed in 1000 consecutive ambulatory, chronic HF patients (72.7\% men; mean age 65.8{\textpm}12.1~years). Significant WL was defined as a loss of {$\geq$}5\% weight between baseline and 1 year. Obesity was defined as body mass index {$\geq$}30~kg/m(2) (N=272). Of the 1000 patients included, 170 experienced significant WL during the first year of follow-up. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with significant WL (27.6\% versus 15.3\%, P{$<$}0.001). In univariable Cox regression analysis, patients with significant WL had 2-fold higher mortality (hazard ratio 1.95 [95\% CI 1.39-2.72], P{$<$}0.001). In multivariable analysis, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular ejection fraction, HF duration, ischemic etiology, diabetes, and treatment, significant WL remained independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio 1.89 [95\% CI 1.32-2.68], P{$<$}0.001). Among obese patients with HF, significant WL was associated with an even more ominous prognosis (adjusted hazard ratio for death of 2.38 [95\% CI 1.31-4.32], P=0.004) than that observed in nonobese patients (adjusted hazard ratio 1.83 [95\% CI 1.16-2.89], P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss {$\geq$}5\% in patients with chronic HF was associated with high long-term mortality, particularly among obese patients with HF.},

  abstract = {Dysregulated amino acid increases the risk for heart failure (HF) via unclear mechanisms. Here, we find that increased plasma tyrosine and phenylalanine levels are associated with HF. Increasing tyrosine or phenylalanine by high-tyrosine or high-phenylalanine chow feeding exacerbates HF phenotypes in transverse aortic constriction and isoproterenol infusion mice models. Knocking down phenylalanine dehydrogenase abolishes the effect of phenylalanine, indicating that phenylalanine functions by converting to tyrosine. Mechanistically, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS) binds to ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related gene (ATR), catalyzes lysine tyrosylation (K-Tyr) of ATR, and activates the DNA damage response (DDR) in the nucleus. Increased tyrosine inhibits the nuclear localization of YARS, inhibits the ATR-mediated DDR, accumulates DNA damage, and elevates cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Enhancing ATR K-Tyr by overexpressing YARS, restricting tyrosine, or supplementing tyrosinol, a structural analog of tyrosine, promotes YARS nuclear localization and alleviates HF in mice. Our findings implicate facilitating YARS nuclear translocation as a potential preventive and/or interfering measure against HF.},

SGLT1 is primarily expressed in the small intestine and its inhibition may be a more suitable therapeutic target. We aimed to investigate the association of genetically proxied SGLT1i with gout risk, serum urate levels and cardiovascular safety using Mendelian randomisation (MR). Methods Leveraging data from a genome-wide association study of 344,182 individuals in the UK Biobank, we identified a missense variant in the SLC5A1 gene that associated with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) to proxy SGLT1i. Outcome genetic data comprised 13,179 gout cases and 750,634 controls, 457,690 individuals for serum urate levels, and up to 977,323 individuals for cardiovascular safety outcomes. We applied the Wald ratio method and investigated potential genetic confounding using colocalization. Results The rs17683430 missense variant was selected to instrument SGLT1i. Genetically proxied SGLT1i was associated with 75\% reduction in gout risk (OR 0.25; 95\%CI 0.06, 0.99; p~=~0.048) and 32.0~{$\mu$}mol/L reduction in serum urate (95\%CI -56.7, -7.3; p~=~0.01), per 6.7~mmol/mol reduction in HbA1c. SGLT1i was associated with increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.37~mmol/L; 95\%CI 0.17, 0.56; p~=~0.0002) but not risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, or chronic kidney disease. Colocalization did not suggest that results are attributable to genetic confounding. Conclusion SGLT1 inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic option for preventing gout in people with or without comorbid diabetes. Randomised trials are needed to formally investigate efficacy and safety.},

  abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, with rare pathogenic variants found in about a third of cases (sarcomere-positive). Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrate that common genetic variation contributes substantially to HCM risk. Here, we derive polygenic scores (PGS) from HCM GWAS, and multi-trait analysis of GWAS incorporating genetically-correlated traits, and test their performance in the UK Biobank, 100,000 Genomes Project, and across clinical cohorts. Higher PGS substantially increases population risk of HCM, particularly amongst sarcomere-positive carriers where HCM penetrance differs 10-fold between those in the highest and lowest PGS quintiles. In relatives of HCM patients, PGS stratifies risks of developing HCM and adverse outcomes. Finally, PGS strongly predicts risk of adverse outcomes in HCM, with a 4 to 6-fold increase in death between cases in the highest and lowest PGS quintiles. These findings promise broad clinical utility of PGS in the general population, in cases, and in families with HCM, enabling tailored screening and surveillance, and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes.},

We report a genome-wide association study and multi-trait analysis of DCM (14,256 cases) and three left ventricular traits (36,203 UK Biobank participants). We identified 80 genomic risk loci and prioritized 62 putative effector genes, including several with rare variant DCM associations (MAP3K7, NEDD4L and SSPN). Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, we identify cellular states, biological pathways, and intracellular communications that drive pathogenesis. We demonstrate that polygenic scores predict DCM in the general population and modify penetrance in carriers of rare DCM variants. Our findings may inform the design of genetic testing strategies that incorporate polygenic background.

HF is a shared chronic phase of cardiac functional impairment secondary to many aetiologies, and patients with HF experience numerous symptoms that affect their quality of life, including dyspnoea, fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, and fluid retention. Although the underlying causes of HF vary according to sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, and environment, the majority of cases remain preventable. HF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and confers a substantial burden to the health-care system. HF is a leading cause of hospitalization among adults and the elderly. In the USA, the total medical costs for patients with HF are expected to rise from US\$20.9 billion in 2012 to \$53.1 billion by 2030. Improvements in the medical management of risk factors and HF have stabilized the incidence of this disease in many countries. In this Review, we provide an overview of the latest epidemiological data on HF, and propose future directions for reducing the ever-increasing HF burden.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effects of empagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, in addition to standard care, on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk are not known. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients to receive 10 mg or 25 mg of empagliflozin or placebo once daily. The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, as analyzed in the pooled empagliflozin group versus the placebo group. The key secondary composite outcome was the primary outcome plus hospitalization for unstable angina. RESULTS: A total of 7020 patients were treated (median observation time, 3.1 years). The primary outcome occurred in 490 of 4687 patients (10.5\%) in the pooled empagliflozin group and in 282 of 2333 patients (12.1\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.86; 95.02\% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99; P=0.04 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of myocardial infarction or stroke, but in the empagliflozin group there were significantly lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes (3.7\%, vs. 5.9\% in the placebo group; 38\% relative risk reduction), hospitalization for heart failure (2.7\% and 4.1\%, respectively; 35\% relative risk reduction), and death from any cause (5.7\% and 8.3\%, respectively; 32\% relative risk reduction). There was no significant between-group difference in the key secondary outcome (P=0.08 for superiority). Among patients receiving empagliflozin, there was an increased rate of genital infection but no increase in other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events who received empagliflozin, as compared with placebo, had a lower rate of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome and of death from any cause when the study drug was added to standard care.

  abstract = {Genetic variants can be used to prioritize risk factors as potential therapeutic targets via Mendelian randomization (MR). An agnostic statistical framework using Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) can disentangle the causal role of correlated risk factors with shared genetic predictors. Here, our objective is to identify lipoprotein measures as mediators between lipid-associated genetic variants and coronary artery disease (CAD) for the purpose of detecting therapeutic targets for CAD.As risk factors we consider 30 lipoprotein measures and metabolites derived from a high-throughput metabolomics study including 24~925 participants. We fit multivariable MR models of genetic associations with CAD estimated in 453~595 participants (including 113~937 cases) regressed on genetic associations with the risk factors. MR-BMA assigns to each combination of risk factors a model score quantifying how well the genetic associations with CAD are explained. Risk factors are ranked by their marginal score and selected using false-discovery rate (FDR) criteria. We perform supplementary and sensitivity analyses varying the dataset for genetic associations with CAD.In the main analysis, the top combination of risk factors ranked by the model score contains apolipoprotein B (ApoB) only. ApoB is also the highest ranked risk factor with respect to the marginal score (FDR \&lt;0.005). Additionally, ApoB is selected in all sensitivity analyses. No other measure of cholesterol or triglyceride is consistently selected otherwise.Our agnostic genetic investigation prioritizes ApoB across all datasets considered, suggesting that ApoB, representing the total number of hepatic-derived lipoprotein particles, is the primary lipid determinant of CAD.},
