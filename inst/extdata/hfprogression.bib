  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature regarding the familial heritability of heart failure and to discuss the possible mechanisms through which this risk is mediated. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from the Framingham Heart Study recently showed that the parental occurrence of heart failure increases the risk of heart failure in offspring. Although the mechanisms mediating this increased risk are not elucidated, heritable risks of heart failure may result from genes affecting the cardiac or vascular systems. Alternatively, familial risk may be mediated partly through the inheritance of recognized or as yet unidentified risk factors for heart failure. Heritable components or genetic loci for quantitative traits contribute to the development of hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, valvular heart disease, and metabolic conditions, which collectively increase the risk of heart failure. SUMMARY: A careful assessment of the family history of heart failure and associated risk factors may identify treatable targets that can potentially reduce the likelihood of developing heart failure, and can assist in the implementation of preventive strategies for risk populations with stages A and B heart failure.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have provided many genetic markers that can be used as instrumental variables to adjust for confounding in epidemiological studies. Recently, the principle has been applied to other forms of bias in observational studies, especially collider bias that arises when conditioning or stratifying on a variable that is associated with the outcome of interest. An important case is in studies of disease progression and survival. Here, we clarify the links between the genetic instrumental variable methods proposed for this problem and the established methods of Mendelian randomisation developed to account for confounding. We highlight the critical importance of weak instrument bias in this context and describe a corrected weighted least-squares procedure as a simple approach to reduce this bias. We illustrate the range of available methods on two data examples. The first, waist-hip ratio adjusted for body-mass index, entails statistical adjustment for a quantitative trait. The second, smoking cessation, is a stratified analysis conditional on having initiated smoking. In both cases, we find little effect of collider bias on the primary association results, but this may propagate into more substantial effects on further analyses such as polygenic risk scoring and Mendelian randomisation.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the heritability as well as genetic and environmental correlations of left ventricular (LV) structural and functional traits in complex pedigrees of a Caucasian population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly recruited 459 white European subjects from 52 families (50\% women; mean age 45 years). LV structure was measured by M-mode and 2D echocardiography and LV function was measured by conventional Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Other measurements included blood pressure, anthropometric, and biochemical measurements. We estimated the heritability of LV traits while adjusting for covariables, including sex, age, body height and weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart rate. With full adjustment, heritability of LV mass was 0.23 (P= 0.025). The TDI-derived mitral annular velocities Ea and Aa showed moderate heritability (h(2)= 0.36 and 0.53, respectively), whereas the mitral inflow A peak had weak heritability (h(2) = 0.25) and the E peak was not heritable (h(2) = 0.11). We partitioned the total phenotypic correlation when it reached significance, into a genetic and an environmental component. The genetic correlations were 0.61 between the E and Ea peaks and 0.90 between the A and Aa peaks. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated moderate heritability for LV mass as well as the mitral annular Ea and Aa peaks. We also found significant genetic correlations between the E and Ea peaks and between the A and Aa peaks. Our current findings support the ongoing research to map and detect genetic variants that contribute to the variation in LV mass and other LV structural and functional phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives The genetic basis of Parkinson disease (PD) motor progression is largely unknown. Previous studies of the genetics of PD progression have included small cohorts and shown a limited overlap with genetic PD risk factors from case-control studies. Here, we have studied genomic variation associated with PD motor severity and early-stage progression in large longitudinal cohorts to help to define the biology of PD progression and potential new drug targets. Methods We performed a GWAS meta-analysis of early PD motor severity and progression up to 3 years from study entry. We used linear mixed-effect models with additive effects, corrected for age at diagnosis, sex, and the first 5 genetic principal components to assess variability in axial, limb, and total Movement Disorder Society{\textendash}Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III scores. Results We included 3,572 unrelated European ancestry patients with PD from 5 observational cohorts and 1 drug trial. The average AAO was 62.6 years (SD = 9.83), and 63\% of participants were male. We found an average increase in the total MDS-UPDRS III score of 2.3 points/year. We identified an association between PD axial motor progression and variation at the GJA5 locus at 1q12 ({$\beta$} = -0.25, SE = 0.04, p = 3.4e-10). Exploration of the regulation of gene expression in the region (cis-expression quantitative trait loci [eQTL] analysis) showed that the lead variant was associated with expression of ACP6, a lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase that regulates mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis (cis-eQTL p-values in blood and brain RNA expression data sets: {$<$}10-14 in eQTLGen and 10-7 in PsychEncode). Discussion Our study highlights the potential role of mitochondrial lipid homeostasis in the progression of PD, which may be important in establishing new drug targets that might modify disease progression.},

  abstract = {Genetic studies of disease progression can be used to identify factors that may influence survival or prognosis, which may differ from factors that influence on disease susceptibility. Studies of disease progression feed directly into therapeutics for disease, whereas studies of incidence inform prevention strategies. However, studies of disease progression are known to be affected by collider (also known as "index event") bias since the disease progression phenotype can only be observed for individuals who have the disease. This applies equally to observational and genetic studies, including genome-wide association studies and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. In this paper, our aim is to review several statistical methods that can be used to detect and adjust for index event bias in studies of disease progression, and how they apply to genetic and MR studies using both individual- and summary-level data. Methods to detect the presence of index event bias include the use of negative controls, a comparison of associations between risk factors for incidence in individuals with and without the disease, and an inspection of Miami plots. Methods to adjust for the bias include inverse probability weighting (with individual-level data), or Slope-Hunter and Dudbridge et al.'s index event bias adjustment (when only summary-level data are available). We also outline two approaches for sensitivity analysis. We then illustrate how three methods to minimise bias can be used in practice with two applied examples. Our first example investigates the effects of blood lipid traits on mortality from coronary heart disease, while our second example investigates genetic associations with breast cancer mortality.},

  abstract = {The past decade has been proclaimed as a hugely successful era of gene discovery through the high yields of many genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, much of the perceived benefit of such discoveries lies in the promise that the identification of genes that influence disease would directly translate into the identification of potential therapeutic targets, but this has yet to be realized at a level reflecting expectation. One reason for this, we suggest, is that GWAS, to date, have generally not focused on phenotypes that directly relate to the progression of disease and thus speak to disease treatment.},
