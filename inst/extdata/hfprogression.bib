  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature regarding the familial heritability of heart failure and to discuss the possible mechanisms through which this risk is mediated. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from the Framingham Heart Study recently showed that the parental occurrence of heart failure increases the risk of heart failure in offspring. Although the mechanisms mediating this increased risk are not elucidated, heritable risks of heart failure may result from genes affecting the cardiac or vascular systems. Alternatively, familial risk may be mediated partly through the inheritance of recognized or as yet unidentified risk factors for heart failure. Heritable components or genetic loci for quantitative traits contribute to the development of hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, valvular heart disease, and metabolic conditions, which collectively increase the risk of heart failure. SUMMARY: A careful assessment of the family history of heart failure and associated risk factors may identify treatable targets that can potentially reduce the likelihood of developing heart failure, and can assist in the implementation of preventive strategies for risk populations with stages A and B heart failure.},

  abstract = {Obesity is a major public health challenge worldwide. It is costly, predisposes to many cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD), is increasing at an alarming rate, and disproportionately affects people of low-socioeconomic status. It has a myriad of deleterious effects on the body, particularly on the CV system. Obesity is a major risk factor for heart failure (HF) and highly prevalent in this population, particularly in those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), to the extent that an obesity HFpEF phenotype has been proposed in the literature. However, once HF is developed, an obesity paradox exists where those with obesity have better short- and mid-term survival than normal or underweight individuals, despite a greater risk for hospitalizations. It may be argued that excess energy reserve, younger patient population, higher tolerability of HF therapy and better nutritional status may account for at least part of the obesity paradox on survival. Furthermore, body mass index (BMI) may not be an accurate measure of body composition, especially in HF, where there is an excess volume status. BMI also fails to delineate fat-free mass and its components, which is a better predictor of functional capacity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), which particularly is increasingly being recognized as a risk modifier in both healthy individuals and in persons with comorbidities, particularly in HF. Notably, when CRF is accounted for, the obesity paradox disappears, suggesting that improving CRF might represent a therapeutic target with greater importance than changes in body weight in the setting of HF. In this narrative review, we discuss the current trends in obesity, the causal link between obesity and HF, an update on the obesity paradox, and a description of the major flaws of BMI in this population. We also present an overview of the latest in HF therapy, weight loss, CRF, and the application of these therapeutic approaches in patients with HF and concomitant obesity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic impacts of noncardiac comorbidities in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) compared with those with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of information on the comparative prognostic significance of comorbidities between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF. METHODS: In a national ambulatory cohort of veterans with HF, the comorbidity burden of 15 noncardiac comorbidities and the impacts of these comorbidities on hospitalization and mortality were compared between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 2,843 patients with HFpEF and 6,599 with HFrEF with 2-year follow-up. Compared with patients with HFrEF, those with HFpEF were older and had higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, psychiatric disorders, anemia, obesity, peptic ulcer disease, and cancer but a lower prevalence of chronic kidney disease. Patients with HFpEF had lower HF hospitalization, higher non-HF hospitalization, and similar overall hospitalization compared with those with HFrEF (p {$<$} 0.001, p {$<$} 0.001, and p = 0.19, respectively). An Increasing number of noncardiac comorbidities was associated with a higher risk for all-cause admissions (p {$<$} 0.001). Comorbidities had similar impacts on mortality in patients with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF, except for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which was associated with a higher hazard (1.62 [95\% confidence interval: 1.36 to 1.92] vs. 1.23 [95\% confidence interval: 1.11 to 1.37], respectively, p = 0.01 for interaction) in patients with HFpEF. CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher noncardiac comorbidity burden associated with higher non-HF hospitalizations in patients with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF. However, individually, most comorbidities have similar impacts on mortality in both groups. Aggressive management of comorbidities may have an overall greater prognostic impact in HFpEF compared to HFrEF.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: There are few effective treatments for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Short-term administration of inorganic nitrite or nitrate preparations has been shown to enhance nitric oxide signaling, which may improve aerobic capacity in HFpEF. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of 4 weeks' administration of inhaled, nebulized inorganic nitrite on exercise capacity in HFpEF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment, crossover trial of 105 patients with HFpEF. Participants were enrolled from July 22, 2016, to September 12, 2017, at 17 US sites, with final date of follow-up of January 2, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Inorganic nitrite or placebo administered via micronebulizer device. During each 6-week phase of the crossover study, participants received no study drug for 2 weeks (baseline/washout) followed by study drug (nitrite or placebo) at 46 mg 3 times a day for 1 week followed by 80 mg 3 times a day for 3 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min). Secondary end points included daily activity levels assessed by accelerometry, health status as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (score range, 0-100, with higher scores reflecting better quality of life), functional class, cardiac filling pressures assessed by echocardiography, N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels, other exercise indices, adverse events, and tolerability. Outcomes were assessed after treatment for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Among 105 patients who were randomized (median age, 68 years; 56\% women), 98 (93\%) completed the trial. During the nitrite phase, there was no significant difference in mean peak oxygen consumption as compared with the placebo phase (13.5 vs 13.7 mL/kg/min; difference, -0.20 [95\% CI, -0.56 to 0.16]; P\,=\,.27). There were no significant between-treatment phase differences in daily activity levels (5497 vs 5503 accelerometry units; difference, -15 [95\% CI, -264 to 234]; P\,=\,.91), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (62.6 vs 61.9; difference, 1.1 [95\% CI, -1.4 to 3.5]; P\,=\,.39), functional class (2.5 vs 2.5; difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -0.1 to 0.2]; P\,=\,.43), echocardiographic E/e' ratio (16.4 vs 16.6; difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -1.2 to 1.3]; P\,=\,.93), or N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels (520 vs 533 pg/mL; difference, 11 [95\% CI, -53 to 75]; P\,=\,.74). Worsening heart failure occurred in 3 participants (2.9\%) during the nitrite phase and 8 (7.6\%) during the placebo phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with HFpEF, administration of inhaled inorganic nitrite for 4 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity.

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization investigations are becoming more powerful and simpler to perform, due to the increasing size and coverage of genome-wide association studies and the increasing availability of summarized data on genetic associations with risk factors and disease outcomes. However, when using multiple genetic variants from different gene regions in a Mendelian randomization analysis, it is highly implausible that all the genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable assumptions. This means that a simple instrumental variable analysis alone should not be relied on to give a causal conclusion. In this article, we discuss a range of sensitivity analyses that will either support or question the validity of causal inference from a Mendelian randomization analysis with multiple genetic variants. We focus on sensitivity analyses of greatest practical relevance for ensuring robust causal inferences, and those that can be undertaken using summarized data. Aside from cases in which the justification of the instrumental variable assumptions is supported by strong biological understanding, a Mendelian randomization analysis in which no assessment of the robustness of the findings to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions has been made should be viewed as speculative and incomplete. In particular, Mendelian randomization investigations with large numbers of genetic variants without such sensitivity analyses should be treated with skepticism.},

Recently, the principle has been applied to other forms of bias in observational studies, especially collider bias that arises when conditioning or stratifying on a variable that is associated with the outcome of interest. An important case is in studies of disease progression and survival. Here, we clarify the links between the genetic instrumental variable methods proposed for this problem and the established methods of Mendelian randomisation developed to account for confounding. We highlight the critical importance of weak instrument bias in this context and describe a corrected weighted least-squares procedure as a simple approach to reduce this bias. We illustrate the range of available methods on two data examples. The first, waist-hip ratio adjusted for body-mass index, entails statistical adjustment for a quantitative trait. The second, smoking cessation, is a stratified analysis conditional on having initiated smoking. In both cases, we find little effect of collider bias on the primary association results, but this may propagate into more substantial effects on further analyses such as polygenic risk scoring and Mendelian randomisation.},

Two recent independent cardiovascular SNP array studies identified a common SNP at 1p36 in intron 2 of the HSPB7 gene as being associated with heart failure. HSPB7 resequencing identified other risk alleles but no functional gene variants. Here, we further show no effect of the HSPB7 SNP on cardiac HSPB7 mRNA levels or splicing, suggesting that the SNP marks the position of a functional variant in another gene. Accordingly, we used massively parallel platforms to resequence all coding exons of the adjacent CLCNKA gene, which encodes the K(a) renal chloride channel (ClC-K(a)). Of 51 exonic CLCNKA variants identified, one SNP (rs10927887, encoding Arg83Gly) was common, in linkage disequilibrium with the heart failure risk SNP in HSPB7, and associated with heart failure in two independent Caucasian referral populations (n = 2,606 and 1,168; combined P = 2.25 {\texttimes} 10(-6)). Individual genotyping of rs10927887 in the two study populations and a third independent heart failure cohort (combined n = 5,489) revealed an additive allele effect on heart failure risk that is independent of age, sex, and prior hypertension (odds ratio = 1.27 per allele copy; P = 8.3 {\texttimes} 10(-7)). Functional characterization of recombinant wild-type Arg83 and variant Gly83 ClC-K(a) chloride channel currents revealed {$\approx$} 50\% loss-of-function of the variant channel. These findings identify a common, functionally significant genetic risk factor for Caucasian heart failure. The variant CLCNKA risk allele, telegraphed by linked variants in the adjacent HSPB7 gene, uncovers a previously overlooked genetic mechanism affecting the cardio-renal axis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. We therefore evaluated the long-term effects of the addition of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure. METHODS: A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours. RESULTS: Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure; 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P{$<$}0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life as compared with placebo (P{$<$}0.01). In a post hoc analysis of the combined end point and mortality in subgroups defined according to base-line treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients receiving neither or one of these types of drugs but an adverse effect in patients receiving both types of drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Valsartan significantly reduces the combined end point of mortality and morbidity and improves clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, when added to prescribed therapy. However, the post hoc observation of an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta-blocker raises concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Few investigations have been conducted to identify genetic determinants of common, polygenetic forms of heart failure (HF), and only a limited number of these genetic associations have been validated by multiple groups. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a case-control study to further investigate the potential impact of 14 previously reported candidate genes on the risk of HF and specific HF sub-types. We also performed an exploratory genome-wide study. We included 799 patients with HF and 1529 controls. After adjusting for age, sex, and genetic ancestry, we found that the C allele of rs2234962 in BAG3 was associated with a decreased risk of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (odds ratio 0.42, 95\% confidence interval 0.25-0.68, P~=~0.0005), consistent with a previous report. No association for the other primary variants or exploratory genome-wide study was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide independent replication for the association between a common coding variant (rs2234962) in BAG3 and the risk of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.},

  abstract = {Following numerous genome-wide association studies of disease susceptibility, there is increasing interest in genetic associations with prognosis, survival or other subsequent events. Such associations are vulnerable to index event bias, by which selection of subjects according to disease status creates biased associations if common causes of incidence and prognosis are not accounted for. We propose an adjustment for index event bias using the residuals from the regression of genetic effects on prognosis on genetic effects on incidence. Our approach eliminates this bias when direct genetic effects on incidence and prognosis are independent, and otherwise reduces bias in realistic situations. In a study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we reverse a paradoxical association of the strong susceptibility gene MUC5B with increased survival, suggesting instead a significant association with decreased survival. In re-analysis of a study of Crohn's disease prognosis, four regions remain associated at genome-wide significance but with increased standard errors.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure with a strong familial component. We performed an exome-wide array-based association study (EWAS) to assess the contribution of missense variants to sporadic DCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: 116,855 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were analyzed in 2796 DCM patients and 6877 control subjects from 6 populations of European ancestry. We confirmed two previously identified associations with SNVs in BAG3 and ZBTB17 and discovered six novel DCM-associated loci (Q-value{$<$}0.01). The lead-SNVs at novel loci are common and located in TTN, SLC39A8, MLIP, FLNC, ALPK3 and FHOD3. In silico fine mapping identified HSPB7 as the most likely candidate at the ZBTB17 locus. Rare variant analysis (MAF{$<$}0.01) demonstrated significant association for TTN variants only (P = 0.0085). All candidate genes but one (SLC39A8) exhibit preferential expression in striated muscle tissues and mutations in TTN, BAG3, FLNC and FHOD3 are known to cause familial cardiomyopathy. We also investigated a panel of 48 known cardiomyopathy genes. Collectively, rare (n = 228, P = 0.0033) or common (n = 36, P = 0.019) variants with elevated in silico severity scores were associated with DCM, indicating that the spectrum of genes contributing to sporadic DCM extends beyond those identified here. CONCLUSION: We identified eight loci independently associated with sporadic DCM. The functions of the best candidate genes at these loci suggest that proteostasis regulation might play a role in DCM pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Our objective was to better understand the genetic bases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a leading cause of systolic heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted the largest genome-wide association study performed so far in DCM, with 2719 cases and 4440 controls in the discovery population. We identified and replicated two new DCM-associated loci on chromosome 3p25.1 [lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs62232870, P\,=\,8.7 {\texttimes} 10-11 and 7.7 {\texttimes} 10-4 in the discovery and replication steps, respectively] and chromosome 22q11.23 (lead SNP rs7284877, P\,=\,3.3 {\texttimes} 10-8 and 1.4 {\texttimes} 10-3 in the discovery and replication steps, respectively), while confirming two previously identified DCM loci on chromosomes 10 and 1, BAG3 and HSPB7. A genetic risk score constructed from the number of risk alleles at these four DCM loci revealed a 3-fold increased risk of DCM for individuals with 8 risk alleles compared to individuals with 5 risk alleles (median of the referral population). In silico annotation and functional 4C-sequencing analyses on iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes identify SLC6A6 as the most likely DCM gene at the 3p25.1 locus. This gene encodes a taurine transporter whose involvement in myocardial dysfunction and DCM is supported by numerous observations in humans and animals. At the 22q11.23 locus, in silico and data mining annotations, and to a lesser extent functional analysis, strongly suggest SMARCB1 as the candidate culprit gene. CONCLUSION: This study provides a better understanding of the genetic architecture of DCM and sheds light on novel biological pathways underlying heart failure.},

However, the definition of its genetic architecture is limited by the technical challenge of capturing dynamic flow volumes from cardiac imaging at scale. We present DeepFlow, a deep-learning system to extract cardiac flow and volumes from phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A mixed-linear model applied to 37,653 individuals from the UK Biobank reveals genome-wide significant associations across cardiac dynamic flow volumes spanning from aortic forward velocity to aortic regurgitation fraction. Mendelian randomization reveals a causal role for aortic root size in aortic valve regurgitation. Among the most significant contributing variants, localizing genes (near ELN, PRDM6 and ADAMTS7) are implicated in connective tissue and blood pressure pathways. Here we show that DeepFlow cardiac flow phenotyping at scale, combined with genotyping data, reinforces the contribution of connective tissue genes, blood pressure and root size to aortic valve function.},

Conventional analyses of this relationship are susceptible to omitted variable bias from variables that jointly influence both hospital admission and adipose status. We implement a novel quasi-Poisson instrumental variable model in a Mendelian randomization framework, identifying causal effects from random perturbations to germline genetic variation. We estimate the individual and joint effects of BMI, WHR, and WHR adjusted for BMI. We also implement multivariable instrumental variable methods in which the causal effect of one exposure is estimated conditionally on the causal effect of another exposure. Data on 310,471 participants and over 550,000 inpatient admissions in the UK Biobank were used to perform one-sample and two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses. The results supported a causal role of adiposity on hospital admissions, with consistency across all estimates and sensitivity analyses. Point estimates were generally larger than estimates from comparable observational specifications. We observed an attenuation of the BMI effect when adjusting for WHR in the multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses, suggesting that an adverse fat distribution, rather than a higher BMI itself, may drive the relationship between adiposity and risk of hospital admission.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly recruited 459 white European subjects from 52 families (50\% women; mean age 45 years). LV structure was measured by M-mode and 2D echocardiography and LV function was measured by conventional Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Other measurements included blood pressure, anthropometric, and biochemical measurements. We estimated the heritability of LV traits while adjusting for covariables, including sex, age, body height and weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart rate. With full adjustment, heritability of LV mass was 0.23 (P= 0.025). The TDI-derived mitral annular velocities Ea and Aa showed moderate heritability (h(2)= 0.36 and 0.53, respectively), whereas the mitral inflow A peak had weak heritability (h(2) = 0.25) and the E peak was not heritable (h(2) = 0.11). We partitioned the total phenotypic correlation when it reached significance, into a genetic and an environmental component. The genetic correlations were 0.61 between the E and Ea peaks and 0.90 between the A and Aa peaks. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated moderate heritability for LV mass as well as the mitral annular Ea and Aa peaks. We also found significant genetic correlations between the E and Ea peaks and between the A and Aa peaks. Our current findings support the ongoing research to map and detect genetic variants that contribute to the variation in LV mass and other LV structural and functional phenotypes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In individuals without known cardiovascular disease, elevated body mass index (BMI) (weight/height2) is associated with an increased risk of death. However, in patients with certain specific chronic diseases, including heart failure, low BMI has been associated with increased mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the influence of BMI on prognosis using Cox proportional hazards models in 7599 patients (mean age, 65 years; 35\% women) with symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II to IV) and a broad spectrum of left ventricular ejection fractions (mean, 39\%) in the Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) program. During a median follow-up of 37.7 months, 1831 patients died. After adjustment for potential confounders, compared with patients with BMI between 30 and 34.9, patients in lower BMI categories had a graded increase in the risk of death. The hazard ratios (95\% confidence intervals) were 1.22 (1.06 to 1.41), 1.46 (1.24 to 1.71), and 1.69 (1.43 to 2.01) among those with BMI of 25 to 29.9, 22.5 to 24.9, and {$<$} 22.5, respectively. The increase in risk of death among patients with BMI {$>$} or = 35 was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95\% confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.43). The association between BMI and mortality was not altered by age, smoking status, or left ventricular ejection fraction (P for interaction {$>$}0.20). However, lower BMI was associated with a greater risk of all-cause death in patients without edema but not in patients with edema (P for interaction {$<$}0.0001). Lower BMI was associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular death and noncardiovascular death. Baseline BMI did not influence the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure or due to all causes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic heart failure and either reduced or preserved left ventricular systolic function, underweight or low BMI was associated with increased mortality, primarily in patients without evidence of fluid overload (edema).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extreme obesity is recognized to be a risk factor for heart failure. It is unclear whether overweight and lesser degrees of obesity also pose a risk. METHODS: We investigated the relation between the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and the incidence of heart failure among 5881 participants in the Framingham Heart Study (mean age, 55 years; 54 percent women). With the use of Cox proportional-hazards models, the body-mass index was evaluated both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable (normal, 18.5 to 24.9; overweight, 25.0 to 29.9; and obese, 30.0 or more). RESULTS: During follow-up (mean, 14 years), heart failure developed in 496 subjects (258 women and 238 men). After adjustment for established risk factors, there was an increase in the risk of heart failure of 5 percent for men and 7 percent for women for each increment of 1 in body-mass index. As compared with subjects with a normal body-mass index, obese subjects had a doubling of the risk of heart failure. For women, the hazard ratio was 2.12 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.51 to 2.97); for men, the hazard ratio was 1.90 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.30 to 2.79). A graded increase in the risk of heart failure was observed across categories of body-mass index. The hazard ratios per increase in category were 1.46 in women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.72) and 1.37 in men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.67). CONCLUSIONS: In our large, community-based sample, increased body-mass index was associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Given the high prevalence of obesity in the United States, strategies to promote optimal body weight may reduce the population burden of heart failure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between heart failure in parents and the prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and the risk of heart failure in their offspring has not been investigated in a community-based setting. METHODS: We examined the cross-sectional association of heart failure in parents with the prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as well as left ventricular mass, internal dimensions, and wall thickness, in 1497 participants of the Framingham Offspring Study (mean age, 57 years; 819 women) who underwent routine echocardiography. We also investigated prospectively whether heart failure in parents increased the risk of heart failure in 2214 offspring (mean age, 44 years; 1150 women). RESULTS: As compared with the 1039 participants whose parents did not have heart failure, the 458 participants in the cross-sectional cohort who had at least one parent with heart failure were more likely to have increased left ventricular mass (17.0 percent vs. 26.9 percent), left ventricular internal dimensions (18.6 percent vs. 23.4 percent), and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (3.1 percent vs. 5.7 percent); the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios were 1.35 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.84), 1.29 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.72), and 2.37 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 4.61), respectively. In the longitudinal cohort, heart failure developed in 90 offspring during follow-up (mean length of follow-up, 20 years). The age- and sex-adjusted 10-year incidence rates of heart failure were 2.72 percent among offspring with a parent with heart failure, as compared with 1.62 percent among those without a parent with heart failure. This increase in risk persisted after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.60). CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure in parents is associated with an increased prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction cross-sectionally and an elevated risk of heart failure longitudinally. Our data emphasize the contribution of familial factors to the heart-failure burden in the community.},

However, the efficacy of inexpensive readily available oral iron supplementation in heart failure is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To test whether therapy with oral iron improves peak exercise capacity in patients with HFrEF and iron deficiency. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of patients with HFrEF ({$<$}40\%) and iron deficiency, defined as a serum ferritin level of 15 to 100 ng/mL or a serum ferritin level of 101 to 299 ng/mL with transferrin saturation of less than 20\%. Participants were enrolled between September 2014 and November 2015 at 23 US sites. INTERVENTIONS: Oral iron polysaccharide (n\,=\,111) or placebo (n\,=\,114), 150 mg twice daily for 16 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was a change in peak oxygen uptake ({\.V}o2) from baseline to 16 weeks. Secondary end points were change in 6-minute walk distance, plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, and health status as assessed by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ, range 0-100, higher scores reflect better quality of life). RESULTS: Among 225 randomized participants (median age, 63 years; 36\% women) 203 completed the study. The median baseline peak {\.V}o2 was 1196 mL/min (interquartile range [IQR], 887-1448 mL/min) in the oral iron group and 1167 mL/min (IQR, 887-1449 mL/min) in the placebo group. The primary end point, change in peak {\.V}o2 at 16 weeks, did not significantly differ between the oral iron and placebo groups (+23 mL/min vs -2 mL/min; difference, 21 mL/min [95\% CI, -34 to +76 mL/min]; P\,=\,.46). Similarly, at 16 weeks, there were no significant differences between treatment groups in changes in 6-minute walk distance (-13 m; 95\% CI, -32 to 6 m), NT-proBNP levels (159; 95\% CI, -280 to 599 pg/mL), or KCCQ score (1; 95\% CI, -2.4 to 4.4), all P\,{$>$}\,.05. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among participants with HFrEF with iron deficiency, high-dose oral iron did not improve exercise capacity over 16 weeks. These results do not support use of oral iron supplementation in patients with HFrEF. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02188784.},

We propose a method, `Slope-Hunter', that uses model-based clustering to identify and utilise the class of variants only affecting the phenotype to estimate the adjustment factor, assuming this class explains more variation in the phenotype than any other variant classes. Simulation studies show that our approach eliminates the bias and outperforms alternatives even in the presence of genetic correlation. In a study of fasting blood insulin levels (FI) conditional on body mass index, we eliminate paradoxical associations of the underweight loci: COBLLI; PPARG with increased FI, and reveal an association for the locus rs1421085 (FTO). In an analysis of a case-only study for breast cancer mortality, a single region remains associated with more pronounced results.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives The genetic basis of Parkinson disease (PD) motor progression is largely unknown. Previous studies of the genetics of PD progression have included small cohorts and shown a limited overlap with genetic PD risk factors from case-control studies. Here, we have studied genomic variation associated with PD motor severity and early-stage progression in large longitudinal cohorts to help to define the biology of PD progression and potential new drug targets. Methods We performed a GWAS meta-analysis of early PD motor severity and progression up to 3 years from study entry. We used linear mixed-effect models with additive effects, corrected for age at diagnosis, sex, and the first 5 genetic principal components to assess variability in axial, limb, and total Movement Disorder Society--Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III scores. Results We included 3,572 unrelated European ancestry patients with PD from 5 observational cohorts and 1 drug trial. The average AAO was 62.6 years (SD = 9.83), and 63\% of participants were male. We found an average increase in the total MDS-UPDRS III score of 2.3 points/year. We identified an association between PD axial motor progression and variation at the GJA5 locus at 1q12 ({$\beta$} = -0.25, SE = 0.04, p = 3.4e-10). Exploration of the regulation of gene expression in the region (cis-expression quantitative trait loci [eQTL] analysis) showed that the lead variant was associated with expression of ACP6, a lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase that regulates mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis (cis-eQTL p-values in blood and brain RNA expression data sets: {$<$}10-14 in eQTLGen and 10-7 in PsychEncode). Discussion Our study highlights the potential role of mitochondrial lipid homeostasis in the progression of PD, which may be important in establishing new drug targets that might modify disease progression.},

Studies of disease progression feed directly into therapeutics for disease, whereas studies of incidence inform prevention strategies.

In this paper, our aim is to review several statistical methods that can be used to detect and adjust for index event bias in studies of disease progression, and how they apply to genetic and MR studies using both individual- and summary-level data. Methods to detect the presence of index event bias include the use of negative controls, a comparison of associations between risk factors for incidence in individuals with and without the disease, and an inspection of Miami plots. Methods to adjust for the bias include inverse probability weighting (with individual-level data), or Slope-Hunter and Dudbridge et al.'s index event bias adjustment (when only summary-level data are available).

We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

METHODS: We conducted a series of systematic literature searches on the pharmacogenetics of HF therapy to assess the current knowledge on this field. RESULTS: Existing data related to HF pharmacogenomics are still limited. The ADRB1 gene is a likely candidate to predict response to {$\beta$}-blockers. Moreover, the cytochrome P450 2D6 coding gene (CYP2D6) clearly affects the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, although the clinical impact of this association remains to be established. CONCLUSION: Given the rising prevalence of HF and related costs, a more personalized use of HF drugs could have a remarkable benefit for patients, caregivers and healthcare systems.},

We tested a CAD phenotype inclusive of angina (SOFT; ncases = 10,801) as well as a stricter definition without angina (HARD; ncases = 6,482) and selected cases with the former phenotype to conduct a meta-analysis using the two most recent CAD GWAS. This approach identified 13 new loci at genome-wide significance, 12 of which were on our previous list of loci meeting the 5\% FDR threshold, thus providing strong support that the remaining loci identified by FDR represent genuine signals. The 304 independent variants associated at 5\% FDR in this study explain 21.2\% of CAD heritability and identify 243 loci that implicate pathways in blood vessel morphogenesis as well as lipid metabolism, nitric oxide signaling and inflammation.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) has been hypothesized to be involved in atherogenesis through pathways related to inflammation. Darapladib is an oral, selective inhibitor of the Lp-PLA2 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of darapladib in patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: SOLID-TIMI 52 was a multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 13,026 participants within 30 days of hospitalization with an ACS (non-ST-elevation or ST-elevation myocardial infarction [MI]) at 868 sites in 36 countries. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to either once-daily darapladib (160 mg) or placebo on a background of guideline-recommended therapy. Patients were followed up for a median of 2.5 years between December 7, 2009, and December 6, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point (major coronary events) was the composite of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, MI, or urgent coronary revascularization for myocardial ischemia. Kaplan-Meier event rates are reported at 3 years. RESULTS: During a median duration of 2.5 years, the primary end point occurred in 903 patients in the darapladib group and 910 in the placebo group (16.3\% vs 15.6\% at 3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.00 [95\% CI, 0.91-1.09]; P\,=\,.93). The composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke occurred in 824 in the darapladib group and 838 in the placebo group (15.0\% vs 15.0\% at 3 years; HR, 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.90-1.09]; P\,=\,.78). There were no differences between the treatment groups for additional secondary end points, for individual components of the primary end point, or in all-cause mortality (371 events in the darapladib group and 395 in the placebo group [7.3\% vs 7.1\% at 3 years; HR, 0.94 [95\% CI, 0.82-1.08]; P\,=\,.40). Patients were more likely to report an odor-related concern in the darapladib group vs the placebo group (11.5\% vs 2.5\%) and also more likely to report diarrhea (10.6\% vs 5.6\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients who experienced an ACS event, direct inhibition of Lp-PLA2 with darapladib added to optimal medical therapy and initiated within 30 days of hospitalization did not reduce the risk of major coronary events.

Findings from laboratory studies suggest that chronic aldosterone blockade maybe more beneficial in abdominally obese HF-prone rats. In the current study, we investigated if the clinical response to a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in mildly symptomatic HF patients varied by abdominal obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2587 NYHA class II, reduced ejection fraction HF (HFrEF) patients enrolled in the EMPHASIS-HF trial were randomly assigned to eplerenone and placebo. In this post hoc analysis, patients were categorized according to waist circumference (WC) (normal if WC {$<$} 102\,cm in men and\,{$<$}\,88\,cm in women; abdominal obesity if WC {$\geq$} 102\,cm in men and\,{$\geq$}\,88\,cm women). The potential statistical interaction between the treatment and WC was assessed on the primary endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for HF and other secondary endpoints. Over a median follow-up of 21 months, a significant benefit of eplerenone for the primary outcome was noted in both normal [hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.98, P = 0.03] and increased (HR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.37-0.63, P {$<$} 0.0001) WC subgroups, but the latter patients appeared to receive greater benefit than patients with normal WC (P for interaction = 0.01). This suggests a significant quantitative (treatment effect varies in magnitude by subgroup, but is always in same direction) rather than a qualitative interaction (direction of the treatment effect varies by subgroup) between eplerenone and WC in the adjusted analysis. Mean doses of eplerenone, blood pressure and serum potassium changes and adverse events were similar between WC subgroups. CONCLUSION: In EMPHASIS-HF, eplerenone improved outcomes in HFrEF patients with and without abdominal obesity, although the benefit appeared to be more pronounced among those with abdominal obesity. The findings are potentially hypothesis generating and need to be replicated in other HFrEF populations.},

  abstract = {Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The known determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy only partially explain its variability. The purpose of this study was to estimate heritability of left ventricular mass. The study sample included adults in the original Framingham Heart Study and the Framingham Offspring Study who were not receiving antihypertensive medications and who were free of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, valvular heart disease, and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass among first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, and unrelated spouse pairs were calculated to determine the contribution of heredity to the variability in left ventricular mass. After adjustments for age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure, the intraclass correlations between first-degree relatives were .15 (parent-child, P{$<$}.001) to .16 (siblings, P{$<$}.001), between second-degree relatives the correlation was .06 (P=NS), and between spouses it was .05 (P=NS). The estimated heritability of adjusted left ventricular mass was between .24 and .32. The proportion of the variance in sex-specific left ventricular mass explained by age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure was .26 in men and .34 in women. On the basis of intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass, incorporation of adjusted left ventricular mass of a parent or sibling would increase the explained variance by an additional .02 to .03. Heredity explains a small, but discernible proportion of the variance in left ventricular mass. Studies are currently under way to identify genetic markers that predict an individual's predisposition to left ventricular hypertrophy. This knowledge may lead to advances in the prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

  abstract = {Approximately half of patients with heart failure have preserved ejection fraction. There is no proven treatment that improves outcome. The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is complex and includes left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary vascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, and peripheral abnormalities. Multiple lines of evidence point to impaired nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP bioavailability as playing a central role in each of these abnormalities. In contrast to traditional organic nitrate therapies, an alternative strategy to restore NO-cGMP signaling is via inorganic nitrite. Inorganic nitrite, previously considered to be an inert byproduct of NO metabolism, functions as an important in vivo reservoir for NO generation, particularly under hypoxic and acidosis conditions. As such, inorganic nitrite becomes most active at times of greater need for NO signaling, as during exercise when left ventricular filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures increase. Herein, we present the rationale and design for the INDIE-HFpEF trial (Inorganic Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction), which is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study assessing the effect of inhaled inorganic nitrite on peak exercise capacity, conducted in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored Heart Failure Clinical Research Network.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Studies in experimental and human heart failure suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors may enhance cardiovascular function and thus exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with placebo on exercise capacity and clinical status in HFPEF. DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 216 stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction {$\geq$}50\%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity. Participants were randomized from October 2008 through February 2012 at 26 centers in North America. Follow-up was through August 30, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Sildenafil (n = 113) or placebo (n = 103) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point was change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included change in 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite clinical status score (range, 1-n, a higher value indicates better status; expected value with no treatment effect, 95) based on time to death, time to cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization, and change in quality of life for participants without cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization at 24 weeks. RESULTS: Median age was 69 years, and 48\% of patients were women. At baseline, median peak oxygen consumption (11.7 mL/kg/min) and 6-minute walk distance (308 m) were reduced. The median E/e' (16), left atrial volume index (44 mL/m2), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (41 mm Hg) were consistent with chronically elevated left ventricular filling pressures. At 24 weeks, median (IQR) changes in peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) in patients who received placebo (-0.20 [IQR, -0.70 to 1.00]) or sildenafil (-0.20 [IQR, -1.70 to 1.11]) were not significantly different (P = .90) in analyses in which patients with missing week-24 data were excluded, and in sensitivity analysis based on intention to treat with multiple imputation for missing values (mean between-group difference, 0.01 mL/kg/min, [95\% CI, -0.60 to 0.61]). The mean clinical status rank score was not significantly different at 24 weeks between placebo (95.8) and sildenafil (94.2) (P = .85). Changes in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks in patients who received placebo (15.0 m [IQR, -26.0 to 45.0]) or sildenafil (5.0 m [IQR, -37.0 to 55.0]; P = .92) were also not significantly different. Adverse events occurred in 78 placebo patients (76\%) and 90 sildenafil patients (80\%). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 placebo patients (16\%) and 25 sildenafil patients (22\%). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with HFPEF, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with administration of sildenafil for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity or clinical status.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nitrates are commonly prescribed to enhance activity tolerance in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction. We compared the effect of isosorbide mononitrate or placebo on daily activity in such patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, crossover study, 110 patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction were randomly assigned to a 6-week dose-escalation regimen of isosorbide mononitrate (from 30 mg to 60 mg to 120 mg once daily) or placebo, with subsequent crossover to the other group for 6 weeks. The primary end point was the daily activity level, quantified as the average daily accelerometer units during the 120-mg phase, as assessed by patient-worn accelerometers. Secondary end points included hours of activity per day during the 120-mg phase, daily accelerometer units during all three dose regimens, quality-of-life scores, 6-minute walk distance, and levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). RESULTS: In the group receiving the 120-mg dose of isosorbide mononitrate, as compared with the placebo group, there was a nonsignificant trend toward lower daily activity (-381 accelerometer units; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -780 to 17; P=0.06) and a significant decrease in hours of activity per day (-0.30 hours; 95\% CI, -0.55 to -0.05; P=0.02). During all dose regimens, activity in the isosorbide mononitrate group was lower than that in the placebo group (-439 accelerometer units; 95\% CI, -792 to -86; P=0.02). Activity levels decreased progressively and significantly with increased doses of isosorbide mononitrate (but not placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in the 6-minute walk distance, quality-of-life scores, or NT-proBNP levels. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction who received isosorbide mononitrate were less active and did not have better quality of life or submaximal exercise capacity than did patients who received placebo.

BACKGROUND: Limited data regarding the prognostic impact of BMI in patients with HFmrEF is available. METHODS: Consecutive patients with HFmrEF (ie, left ventricular ejection fraction 41-49\% and signs and/or symptoms of HF) were retrospectively included at one institution from 2016 to 2022. Risk stratification was performed according to WHO-defined BMI groups. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 months (median follow-up). Kaplan-Meier, uni- and multivariable Cox proportional regression analyses were applied for statistics. RESULTS: 1832 consecutive patients with HFmrEF were included with a median BMI of 26.7 kg/m2 (IQR 24.0-30.8 kg/m2). Patients with lowest BMI (ie, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) were associated with highest risk of all-cause mortality at 30 months compared to patients with higher BMI values (40.0\% vs 29.0\% vs 21.4\% vs 20.9\%; log rank p = 0.001; HR = 0.721; 95\% CI 0.656-0.793; p = 0.001). Even after multivariable adjustment, higher BMI values were associated with improved survival at 30 months (HR = 0.963; 95\% CI 0.943-0.985; p = 0.001). In contrast, the risk of HF- related rehospitalization at 30 months was not affected by BMI (log rank p = 0.064). CONCLUSION: In patients hospitalized with HFmrEF, lower BMI was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30 months, suggesting an obesity paradox in HFmrEF.},

The aim of this study was to determine the heritability of circulating ACE, ACE2, and neprilysin (NEP), which may also be a regulator of BP, in a family study, and to determine covariates that contribute to the variation in plasma activity. ACE, ACE2, and NEP activities were measured in plasma from 534 subjects in the Leeds Family Study using selective fluorogenic substrates. Genetic factors accounted for 24.5\%, 67\%, and 22.7\% of the phenotypic variation in circulating ACE, ACE2, and NEP, respectively. ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism and other measured covariates accounted for 23.8\% of variance in circulating ACE. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was a significant determinant of circulating ACE2. Measured covariates accounted for 17.3\% of variation in circulating NEP. ACE and NEP were associated with systolic and diastolic BP in univariate analyses; however, only ACE was independently associated with systolic and diastolic BP after accounting for covariates and shared childhood household.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modifiable lifestyle factors in relation to risk for cardiomyopathy, a common and increasing cause of heart failure in the young, have not been widely studied. We sought to investigate a potential link between obesity, a recognized predictor of early heart failure, in adolescence and being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in adulthood. METHODS: This was a nationwide register-based prospective cohort study of 1\,668\,893 adolescent men (mean age, 18.3 years; SD, 0.7 years) who enlisted for compulsory military service from 1969 to 2005. At baseline, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and medical disorders were registered, along with test results for fitness and muscle strength. Cardiomyopathy diagnoses were identified from the National Hospital Register and Cause of Death Register during an up to 46-year follow-up and divided into categories: dilated, hypertrophic, alcohol/drug-induced, and other. Hazard ratios were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 27 years; Q1-Q3, 19-35 years), 4477 cases of cardiomyopathy were identified, of which 2631 (59\%) were dilated, 673 (15\%) were hypertrophic, and 480 (11\%) were alcohol/drug-induced. Increasing BMI was strongly associated with elevated risk of cardiomyopathy, especially dilated, starting at levels considered normal (BMI, 22.5-{$<$}25 kg/m2; hazard ratio, 1.38 [95\% CI, 1.22-1.57]), adjusted for age, year, center, and baseline comorbidities, and with a {$>$}8-fold increased risk at BMI {$\geq$}35 kg/m2 compared with BMI of 18.5 to {$<$}20 kg/m2. For each 1-unit increase in BMI, similarly adjusted hazard ratios were 1.15 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.17) for dilated cardiomyopathy, 1.09 (95\% CI, 1.06-1.12) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 1.10 (1.06-1.13) for alcohol/drug-induced cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Even mildly elevated body weight in late adolescence may contribute to being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in adulthood. The already marked importance of weight control in youth is further strengthened by these findings, as well as greater evidence for obesity as a potential important cause of adverse cardiac remodeling that is independent of clinically evident ischemic heart disease.},

  abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Rapid progression of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Most previous studies looking for genetic factors associated with low eGFR have used cross-sectional data. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD, focusing on longitudinal data. They identified three loci (two of them novel) associated with longitudinal eGFR decline. In addition to the known UMOD/PDILT locus, variants within BICC1 were associated with significant differences in longitudinal eGFR slope. Variants within HEATR4 also were associated with differences in eGFR decline, but only among Black/African American individuals without diabetes. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline in CKD and may inform new therapeutic approaches for progressive kidney disease. BACKGROUND: Rapid progression of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite extensive study of the genetics of cross-sectional eGFR, only a few loci associated with eGFR decline over time have been identified. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD-defined by two outpatient eGFR measurements of {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , obtained 90-365 days apart-from the Million Veteran Program and Vanderbilt University Medical Center's DNA biobank. The primary outcome was the annualized relative slope in outpatient eGFR. Analyses were stratified by ethnicity and diabetes status and meta-analyzed thereafter. RESULTS: In cross-ancestry meta-analysis, the strongest association was rs77924615, near UMOD / PDILT ; each copy of the G allele was associated with a 0.30\%/yr faster eGFR decline ( P = 4.9{\texttimes}10 -27 ). We also observed an association within BICC1 (rs11592748), where every additional minor allele was associated with a 0.13\%/yr slower eGFR decline ( P = 5.6{\texttimes}10 -9 ). Among participants without diabetes, the strongest association was the UMOD/PDILT variant rs36060036, associated with a 0.27\%/yr faster eGFR decline per copy of the C allele ( P = 1.9{\texttimes}10 -17 ). Among Black participants, a significantly faster eGFR decline was associated with variant rs16996674 near APOL1 (R 2 =0.29 with the G1 high-risk genotype); among Black participants with diabetes, lead variant rs11624911 near HEATR4 also was associated with a significantly faster eGFR decline. We also nominally replicated loci with known associations with eGFR decline, near PRKAG2, FGF5, and C15ORF54. CONCLUSIONS: Three loci were significantly associated with longitudinal eGFR change at genome-wide significance. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for progressive CKD.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study sought to define the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality in heart failure (HF) across the world and to identify specific groups in whom BMI may differentially mediate risk. Background Obesity is associated with incident HF, but it is paradoxically associated with better prognosis during chronic HF. Methods We studied 6,142 patients with acute decompensated HF from 12 prospective observational cohorts followed-up across 4 continents. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models and net reclassification index described associations of BMI with all-cause mortality. Results Normal-weight patients (BMI 18.5 to 25 kg/m2) were older with more advanced HF and lower cardiometabolic risk. Despite worldwide heterogeneity in clinical features across obesity categories, a higher BMI remained associated with decreased 30-day and 1-year mortality (11\% decrease at 30 days; 9\% decrease at 1 year per 5 kg/m2; p~{$<~$}0.05), after adjustment for clinical risk. The BMI obtained at index admission provided effective 1-year risk reclassification beyond current markers of clinical risk (net reclassification index 0.119, p~{$<$} 0.001). Notably, the ``protective'' association of BMI with mortality was confined to persons with older age ({$>$}75 years; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; p~= 0.006), decreased cardiac function (ejection fraction~{$<$}50\%; HR: 0.85; p~{$<$} 0.001), no diabetes (HR: 0.86; p~{$<$} 0.001), and de novo HF (HR: 0.89; p~= 0.004). Conclusions A lower BMI is associated with age, disease severity, and a higher risk of death in acute decompensated HF. The ``obesity paradox'' is confined to older persons, with decreased cardiac function, less cardiometabolic illness, and recent-onset HF, suggesting that aging, HF severity/chronicity, and metabolism may explain the obesity paradox.},

Twelve independent variants at 11 genomic loci are associated with HF, all of which demonstrate one or more associations with coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, or reduced left ventricular function, suggesting shared genetic aetiology. Functional analysis of non-CAD-associated loci implicate genes involved in cardiac development (MYOZ1, SYNPO2L), protein homoeostasis (BAG3), and cellular senescence (CDKN1A). Mendelian randomisation analysis supports causal roles for several HF risk factors, and demonstrates CAD-independent effects for atrial fibrillation, body mass index, and~hypertension. These findings extend our knowledge of the pathways underlying HF and may inform new therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although genetic factors contribute to the onset of heart failure (HF), no large-scale genome-wide investigation of HF risk has been published to date. We have investigated the association of 2,478,304 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with incident HF by meta-analyzing data from 4 community-based prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eligible participants for these analyses were of European or African ancestry and free of clinical HF at baseline. Each study independently conducted genome-wide scans and imputed data to the approximately 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HapMap. Within each study, Cox proportional hazards regression models provided age- and sex-adjusted estimates of the association between each variant and time to incident HF. Fixed-effect meta-analyses combined results for each single-nucleotide polymorphism from the 4 cohorts to produce an overall association estimate and P value. A genome-wide significance P value threshold was set a priori at 5.0x10(-7). During a mean follow-up of 11.5 years, 2526 incident HF events (12\%) occurred in 20 926 European-ancestry participants. The meta-analysis identified a genome-wide significant locus at chromosomal position 15q22 (1.4x10(-8)), which was 58.8 kb from USP3. Among 2895 African-ancestry participants, 466 incident HF events (16\%) occurred during a mean follow-up of 13.7 years. One genome-wide significant locus was identified at 12q14 (6.7x10(-8)), which was 6.3 kb from LRIG3. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 2 loci that were associated with incident HF and exceeded genome-wide significance. The findings merit replication in other community-based settings of incident HF.},

We ascertained 56 male and 80 female adult same-sex twin pairs from the Flemish population. Plasma renin activity (PRA), the concentration of angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were measured, and path analysis was applied, after transformation toward normality. For PRA and AGT significant heritability was only detected in the male subgroup, with heritability estimates of 66\% and 90\%, respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme concentration was determined by additive genes for 43\% of its variance, by shared environmental influences for 42\%, and by specific environmental influences for 15\%. The high heritability found for AGT is compatible with the results of earlier studies linking the M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene to plasma AGT levels. For PRA, we are the first to show significant heritability. Our results regarding ACE confirm the findings in other populations.},

  abstract = {Recent genetic studies have identified some alleles that are associated with higher BMI but lower risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. These "favorable adiposity" alleles are collectively associated with lower insulin levels and higher subcutaneous-to-visceral adipose tissue ratio and may protect from disease through higher adipose storage capacity. We aimed to use data from 164,609 individuals from the UK Biobank and five other studies to replicate associations between a genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants and adiposity and risk of disease, to test for interactions between BMI and favorable adiposity genetics, and to test effects separately in men and women. In the UK Biobank, the 50\% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles had higher BMIs (0.120 kg/m(2) [95\% CI 0.066, 0.174]; P = 1E-5) and higher body fat percentage (0.301\% [0.230, 0.372]; P = 1E-16) compared with the 50\% of individuals carrying the fewest alleles. For a given BMI, the 50\% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles were at lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.837 [0.784, 0.894]; P = 1E-7), hypertension (OR 0.935 [0.911, 0.958]; P = 1E-7), and heart disease (OR 0.921 [0.872, 0.973]; P = 0.003) and had lower blood pressure (systolic -0.859 mmHg [-1.099, -0.618]; P = 3E-12 and diastolic -0.394 mmHg [-0.534, -0.254]; P = 4E-8). In women, these associations could be explained by the observation that the alleles associated with higher BMI but lower risk of disease were also associated with a favorable body fat distribution, with a lower waist-to-hip ratio (-0.004 cm [95\% CI -0.005, -0.003] 50\% vs. 50\%; P = 3E-14), but in men, the favorable adiposity alleles were associated with higher waist circumference (0.454 cm [0.267, 0.641] 50\% vs. 50\%; P = 2E-6) and higher waist-to-hip ratio (0.0013 [0.0003, 0.0024] 50\% vs. 50\%; P = 0.01). Results were strengthened when a meta-analysis with five additional studies was conducted. There was no evidence of interaction between a genetic score consisting of known BMI variants and the favorable adiposity genetic score. In conclusion, different molecular mechanisms that lead to higher body fat percentage (with greater subcutaneous storage capacity) can have different impacts on cardiometabolic disease risk. Although higher BMI is associated with higher risk of diseases, better fat storage capacity could reduce the risk.},

Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in {$\sim$}450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N~{$\sim$}700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P~{$<~$}1~{\texttimes}~10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain {$\sim$}24.6\% of the variance of height and {$\sim$}6.0\% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were {$\sim$}0.44 and {$\sim$}0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow-up studies.},
