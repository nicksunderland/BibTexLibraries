  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature regarding the familial heritability of heart failure and to discuss the possible mechanisms through which this risk is mediated. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from the Framingham Heart Study recently showed that the parental occurrence of heart failure increases the risk of heart failure in offspring. Although the mechanisms mediating this increased risk are not elucidated, heritable risks of heart failure may result from genes affecting the cardiac or vascular systems. Alternatively, familial risk may be mediated partly through the inheritance of recognized or as yet unidentified risk factors for heart failure. Heritable components or genetic loci for quantitative traits contribute to the development of hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, valvular heart disease, and metabolic conditions, which collectively increase the risk of heart failure. SUMMARY: A careful assessment of the family history of heart failure and associated risk factors may identify treatable targets that can potentially reduce the likelihood of developing heart failure, and can assist in the implementation of preventive strategies for risk populations with stages A and B heart failure.},

  abstract = {Obesity is a major public health challenge worldwide. It is costly, predisposes to many cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD), is increasing at an alarming rate, and disproportionately affects people of low-socioeconomic status. It has a myriad of deleterious effects on the body, particularly on the CV system. Obesity is a major risk factor for heart failure (HF) and highly prevalent in this population, particularly in those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), to the extent that an obesity HFpEF phenotype has been proposed in the literature. However, once HF is developed, an obesity paradox exists where those with obesity have better short- and mid-term survival than normal or underweight individuals, despite a greater risk for hospitalizations. It may be argued that excess energy reserve, younger patient population, higher tolerability of HF therapy and better nutritional status may account for at least part of the obesity paradox on survival. Furthermore, body mass index (BMI) may not be an accurate measure of body composition, especially in HF, where there is an excess volume status. BMI also fails to delineate fat-free mass and its components, which is a better predictor of functional capacity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), which particularly is increasingly being recognized as a risk modifier in both healthy individuals and in persons with comorbidities, particularly in HF. Notably, when CRF is accounted for, the obesity paradox disappears, suggesting that improving CRF might represent a therapeutic target with greater importance than changes in body weight in the setting of HF. In this narrative review, we discuss the current trends in obesity, the causal link between obesity and HF, an update on the obesity paradox, and a description of the major flaws of BMI in this population. We also present an overview of the latest in HF therapy, weight loss, CRF, and the application of these therapeutic approaches in patients with HF and concomitant obesity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic impacts of noncardiac comorbidities in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) compared with those with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of information on the comparative prognostic significance of comorbidities between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF. METHODS: In a national ambulatory cohort of veterans with HF, the comorbidity burden of 15 noncardiac comorbidities and the impacts of these comorbidities on hospitalization and mortality were compared between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 2,843 patients with HFpEF and 6,599 with HFrEF with 2-year follow-up. Compared with patients with HFrEF, those with HFpEF were older and had higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, psychiatric disorders, anemia, obesity, peptic ulcer disease, and cancer but a lower prevalence of chronic kidney disease. Patients with HFpEF had lower HF hospitalization, higher non-HF hospitalization, and similar overall hospitalization compared with those with HFrEF (p {$<$} 0.001, p {$<$} 0.001, and p = 0.19, respectively). An Increasing number of noncardiac comorbidities was associated with a higher risk for all-cause admissions (p {$<$} 0.001). Comorbidities had similar impacts on mortality in patients with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF, except for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which was associated with a higher hazard (1.62 [95\% confidence interval: 1.36 to 1.92] vs. 1.23 [95\% confidence interval: 1.11 to 1.37], respectively, p = 0.01 for interaction) in patients with HFpEF. CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher noncardiac comorbidity burden associated with higher non-HF hospitalizations in patients with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF. However, individually, most comorbidities have similar impacts on mortality in both groups. Aggressive management of comorbidities may have an overall greater prognostic impact in HFpEF compared to HFrEF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and can also have kidney benefits. However, whether GLP-1 receptor agonists improve clinically important kidney outcomes remains uncertain. We aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: For this meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials that included at least 500 participants with type 2 diabetes, compared a GLP-1 receptor agonist with placebo with at least 12 months of follow-up, and reported a primary clinical kidney or cardiovascular outcome, from database inception to March 26, 2024. Post hoc, we included the SELECT trial (NCT03574597), which enrolled participants with cardiovascular disease and a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or more without diabetes. Study-level summary data were extracted independently by two authors for inclusion in this random-effects analysis. The main kidney outcome was a composite outcome, consisting of kidney failure (kidney replacement therapy or a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] {$<$}15 mL/min per 1{$\cdot$}73 m2), a sustained reduction in eGFR by at least 50\% or the nearest equivalent, or death from kidney failure. The main cardiovascular outcome was MACE, consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024528864. FINDINGS: Of the 5140 records identified through the literature search, 11 trials, involving 85\,373 participants (29\,386 female, 55\,987 male), were included in the meta-analysis. In participants with type 2 diabetes (67\,769), GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced the composite kidney outcome by 18\% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}82, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}73-0{$\cdot$}93; I2 =26{$\cdot$}41\%), kidney failure by 16\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}84, 0{$\cdot$}72-0{$\cdot$}99; I2 =0\%), MACE by 13\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}87, 0{$\cdot$}81-0{$\cdot$}93; I2 =49{$\cdot$}75\%), and all-cause death by 12\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}88, 0{$\cdot$}83-0{$\cdot$}93; I2 =0\%). The effect on the composite kidney outcome (HR 0{$\cdot$}81, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}72-0{$\cdot$}92; I2 =23{$\cdot$}11\%), kidney failure (HR 0{$\cdot$}84, 0{$\cdot$}72-0{$\cdot$}98; I2 =0\%), MACE (HR 0{$\cdot$}86, 0{$\cdot$}80-0{$\cdot$}92; I2 =48{$\cdot$}9\%), and all-cause death (HR 0{$\cdot$}87, 0{$\cdot$}82-0{$\cdot$}91; I2 =0\%) was similar when the SELECT trial was included, with no evidence of heterogeneity between this trial and those including participants with type 2 diabetes (pheterogeneity {$>$}0{$\cdot$}05). There was no difference in the risk of serious adverse events, including acute pancreatitis and severe hypoglycaemia, between the GLP-1 receptor agonist and placebo groups (risk ratio [RR] 0{$\cdot$}95, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}90-1{$\cdot$}01; I2 =88{$\cdot$}5\%). However, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred more frequently in the GLP-1 receptor agonist groups (RR 1{$\cdot$}51, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}18-1{$\cdot$}94; I2 =96{$\cdot$}3\%). INTERPRETATION: We found evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists significantly reduce clinically important kidney events, kidney failure, and cardiovascular events. FUNDING: None.},

The objective of the present report is to demonstrate how confounding bias due to cigarette smoking is increased in the presence of collider stratification bias using an empirical example and directed acyclic graphs. The empirical example uses data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a prospective cohort study of 15,792 men and women in the United States. Poisson regression models were used to examine the confounding effect of smoking. In the total ARIC study population, smoking produced a confounding bias of {$<$}3 percentage points. This result was obtained by comparing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for obesity from a model adjusted for smoking was 1.07 (95~\% CI 1.00, 1.15) with one that did not adjust for smoking was 1.10 (95~\% CI 1.03, 1.18). However, among smokers with CVD, the obesity IRR was 0.89 (95~\% CI 0.81, 0.99), while among non-smokers with CVD the obesity IRR was 1.20 (95~\% CI 1.03, 1.41). The empirical and graphical explanations presented suggest that the magnitude of the confounding bias induced by smoking is greater in the presence of collider stratification bias.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: There are few effective treatments for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Short-term administration of inorganic nitrite or nitrate preparations has been shown to enhance nitric oxide signaling, which may improve aerobic capacity in HFpEF. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of 4 weeks' administration of inhaled, nebulized inorganic nitrite on exercise capacity in HFpEF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment, crossover trial of 105 patients with HFpEF. Participants were enrolled from July 22, 2016, to September 12, 2017, at 17 US sites, with final date of follow-up of January 2, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Inorganic nitrite or placebo administered via micronebulizer device. During each 6-week phase of the crossover study, participants received no study drug for 2 weeks (baseline/washout) followed by study drug (nitrite or placebo) at 46 mg 3 times a day for 1 week followed by 80 mg 3 times a day for 3 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min). Secondary end points included daily activity levels assessed by accelerometry, health status as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (score range, 0-100, with higher scores reflecting better quality of life), functional class, cardiac filling pressures assessed by echocardiography, N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels, other exercise indices, adverse events, and tolerability. Outcomes were assessed after treatment for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Among 105 patients who were randomized (median age, 68 years; 56\% women), 98 (93\%) completed the trial. During the nitrite phase, there was no significant difference in mean peak oxygen consumption as compared with the placebo phase (13.5 vs 13.7 mL/kg/min; difference, -0.20 [95\% CI, -0.56 to 0.16]; P\,=\,.27). There were no significant between-treatment phase differences in daily activity levels (5497 vs 5503 accelerometry units; difference, -15 [95\% CI, -264 to 234]; P\,=\,.91), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (62.6 vs 61.9; difference, 1.1 [95\% CI, -1.4 to 3.5]; P\,=\,.39), functional class (2.5 vs 2.5; difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -0.1 to 0.2]; P\,=\,.43), echocardiographic E/e' ratio (16.4 vs 16.6; difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -1.2 to 1.3]; P\,=\,.93), or N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels (520 vs 533 pg/mL; difference, 11 [95\% CI, -53 to 75]; P\,=\,.74). Worsening heart failure occurred in 3 participants (2.9\%) during the nitrite phase and 8 (7.6\%) during the placebo phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with HFpEF, administration of inhaled inorganic nitrite for 4 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity.

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization investigations are becoming more powerful and simpler to perform, due to the increasing size and coverage of genome-wide association studies and the increasing availability of summarized data on genetic associations with risk factors and disease outcomes. However, when using multiple genetic variants from different gene regions in a Mendelian randomization analysis, it is highly implausible that all the genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable assumptions. This means that a simple instrumental variable analysis alone should not be relied on to give a causal conclusion. In this article, we discuss a range of sensitivity analyses that will either support or question the validity of causal inference from a Mendelian randomization analysis with multiple genetic variants. We focus on sensitivity analyses of greatest practical relevance for ensuring robust causal inferences, and those that can be undertaken using summarized data. Aside from cases in which the justification of the instrumental variable assumptions is supported by strong biological understanding, a Mendelian randomization analysis in which no assessment of the robustness of the findings to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions has been made should be viewed as speculative and incomplete. In particular, Mendelian randomization investigations with large numbers of genetic variants without such sensitivity analyses should be treated with skepticism.},

This demonstrates that the hypothalamic GLP-1R is sufficient but does not show whether it is necessary for the effects of exogenous GLP-1R agonists (GLP-1RA) or endogenous GLP-1 on these parameters. To address this, we crossed mice harboring floxed Glp1r alleles to mice expressing Nkx2.1-Cre to knock down Glp1r expression throughout the hypothalamus (GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Nkx2.1cre). We also generated mice lacking Glp1r expression specifically in two GLP-1RA--responsive hypothalamic feeding nuclei/cell types, the paraventricular nucleus (GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Sim1cre) and proopiomelanocortin neurons (GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}POMCcre). Chow-fed GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Nkx2.1cre mice exhibited increased food intake and energy expenditure with no net effect on body weight. When fed a high-fat diet, these mice exhibited normal food intake but elevated energy expenditure, yielding reduced weight gain. None of these phenotypes were observed in GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Sim1cre and GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}POMCcre mice. The acute anorectic and glucose tolerance effects of peripherally dosed GLP-1RA exendin-4 and liraglutide were preserved in all mouse lines. Chronic liraglutide treatment reduced body weight in chow-fed GLP-1RKD{$\Delta$}Nkx2.1cre mice, but this effect was attenuated with high-fat diet feeding. In sum, classic homeostatic control regions are sufficient but not individually necessary for the effects of GLP-1RA on nutrient homeostasis.},

Recently, the principle has been applied to other forms of bias in observational studies, especially collider bias that arises when conditioning or stratifying on a variable that is associated with the outcome of interest. An important case is in studies of disease progression and survival. Here, we clarify the links between the genetic instrumental variable methods proposed for this problem and the established methods of Mendelian randomisation developed to account for confounding. We highlight the critical importance of weak instrument bias in this context and describe a corrected weighted least-squares procedure as a simple approach to reduce this bias. We illustrate the range of available methods on two data examples. The first, waist-hip ratio adjusted for body-mass index, entails statistical adjustment for a quantitative trait. The second, smoking cessation, is a stratified analysis conditional on having initiated smoking. In both cases, we find little effect of collider bias on the primary association results, but this may propagate into more substantial effects on further analyses such as polygenic risk scoring and Mendelian randomisation.},

Two recent independent cardiovascular SNP array studies identified a common SNP at 1p36 in intron 2 of the HSPB7 gene as being associated with heart failure. HSPB7 resequencing identified other risk alleles but no functional gene variants. Here, we further show no effect of the HSPB7 SNP on cardiac HSPB7 mRNA levels or splicing, suggesting that the SNP marks the position of a functional variant in another gene. Accordingly, we used massively parallel platforms to resequence all coding exons of the adjacent CLCNKA gene, which encodes the K(a) renal chloride channel (ClC-K(a)). Of 51 exonic CLCNKA variants identified, one SNP (rs10927887, encoding Arg83Gly) was common, in linkage disequilibrium with the heart failure risk SNP in HSPB7, and associated with heart failure in two independent Caucasian referral populations (n = 2,606 and 1,168; combined P = 2.25 {\texttimes} 10(-6)). Individual genotyping of rs10927887 in the two study populations and a third independent heart failure cohort (combined n = 5,489) revealed an additive allele effect on heart failure risk that is independent of age, sex, and prior hypertension (odds ratio = 1.27 per allele copy; P = 8.3 {\texttimes} 10(-7)). Functional characterization of recombinant wild-type Arg83 and variant Gly83 ClC-K(a) chloride channel currents revealed {$\approx$} 50\% loss-of-function of the variant channel. These findings identify a common, functionally significant genetic risk factor for Caucasian heart failure. The variant CLCNKA risk allele, telegraphed by linked variants in the adjacent HSPB7 gene, uncovers a previously overlooked genetic mechanism affecting the cardio-renal axis.},

Heart failure is a chronic, life-threatening disease and the most common reason for hospital admission in people over 65 years of age. Genetic factors that influence heart failure progression have not yet been identified. We performed an exome-wide association study in 8,089 patients with heart failure across two clinical trials, CHARM and CORONA, and one population-based cohort, the UK Biobank. We assessed the genetic determinants of the outcomes `time to cardiovascular death' and `time to cardiovascular death and/or hospitalisation', identifying seven independent exome-wide-significant associated genes, FAM221A, CUTC, IFIT5, STIMATE, TAS2R20, CALB2 and BLK. Leveraging public genomic data resources, transcriptomic and pathway analyses, as well as a machine-learning approach, we annotated and prioritised the identified genes for further target validation experiments. Together, these findings advance our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of heart failure progression and reveal putative new candidate therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. We therefore evaluated the long-term effects of the addition of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure. METHODS: A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours. RESULTS: Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure; 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P{$<$}0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life as compared with placebo (P{$<$}0.01). In a post hoc analysis of the combined end point and mortality in subgroups defined according to base-line treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients receiving neither or one of these types of drugs but an adverse effect in patients receiving both types of drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Valsartan significantly reduces the combined end point of mortality and morbidity and improves clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, when added to prescribed therapy. However, the post hoc observation of an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta-blocker raises concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.},

  abstract = {Although inflammatory cytokines produced by activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential for early host defense against infection, they also mediate a vast array of pathologies, including autoimmune disease, hypersensitivity reactions, and sepsis. Thus, numerous regulatory mechanisms exist in parallel with proinflammatory pathways to prevent excessive release of these potent effector molecules. We report elucidation of a novel regulatory function for interleukin receptor--associated kinase (IRAK)-1 binding protein 1 (IRAK1BP1, also known as SIMPL) through quantitative trait locus mapping of the TLR response in wild-derived mouse strains. This gene emerged as a negative regulator of TLR2-mediated interleukin (IL)-6 production in MOLF/Ei mice, which expressed IRAK1BP1 mRNA in an allele-specific manner when crossed with the C57BL/6J strain. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and primary macrophages from two other wild-derived mouse strains also induced IRAK1BP1 mRNA by 4 hours after stimulation with agonists of various TLRs. Examination of its effects on IL-6 and other cytokines demonstrated that IRAK1BP1 regulates transcription of a specific subset of TLR-responsive genes, producing an overall antiinflammatory profile. Our results reveal that IRAK1BP1 is a critical factor in preventing dangerous overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines by the innate immune system and in influencing the specificity of TLR responses. Furthermore, these results show that the genetic diversity of wild-derived mouse strains makes them a valuable model of important human gene functions that have been lost in some laboratory-inbred strains.},

By using an unbiased forward genetic approach, we previously reported that IL-1R--associated kinase 1 binding protein 1 (IRAK1BP1) down-modulates Toll-like receptor-mediated transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines. To gain insights into the physiological relevance of the inhibitory role of IRAK1BP1 in inflammation, we generated mutant mice lacking IRAK1BP1. Here we report that IRAK1BP1 does not inhibit signaling pathways generally but rather changes the transcriptional profile of activated cells, leading to an increase in IL-10 production and promoting LPS tolerance. This shift in cytokine transcription correlates with an increased ratio of functional NF-{$\kappa$}B subunit dimers comprised of p50/p50 homodimers relative to p50/p65 heterodimers. The increase in nuclear p50/p50 was consistent with the ability of IRAK1BP1 to bind to the p50 precursor molecule and I{$\kappa$}B family member p105. We conclude that IRAK1BP1 functions through its effects on NF-{$\kappa$}B as a molecular switch to bias innate immune pathways toward the resolution of inflammation.},

We aimed to investigate if semaglutide was beneficial in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a history of heart failure compared with placebo; if there was a difference in outcome in patients designated as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction compared with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; and if the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in patients with heart failure was related to baseline characteristics or subtype of heart failure.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Few investigations have been conducted to identify genetic determinants of common, polygenetic forms of heart failure (HF), and only a limited number of these genetic associations have been validated by multiple groups. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a case-control study to further investigate the potential impact of 14 previously reported candidate genes on the risk of HF and specific HF sub-types. We also performed an exploratory genome-wide study. We included 799 patients with HF and 1529 controls. After adjusting for age, sex, and genetic ancestry, we found that the C allele of rs2234962 in BAG3 was associated with a decreased risk of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (odds ratio 0.42, 95\% confidence interval 0.25-0.68, P~=~0.0005), consistent with a previous report. No association for the other primary variants or exploratory genome-wide study was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide independent replication for the association between a common coding variant (rs2234962) in BAG3 and the risk of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.},

  abstract = {Following numerous genome-wide association studies of disease susceptibility, there is increasing interest in genetic associations with prognosis, survival or other subsequent events. Such associations are vulnerable to index event bias, by which selection of subjects according to disease status creates biased associations if common causes of incidence and prognosis are not accounted for. We propose an adjustment for index event bias using the residuals from the regression of genetic effects on prognosis on genetic effects on incidence. Our approach eliminates this bias when direct genetic effects on incidence and prognosis are independent, and otherwise reduces bias in realistic situations. In a study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we reverse a paradoxical association of the strong susceptibility gene MUC5B with increased survival, suggesting instead a significant association with decreased survival. In re-analysis of a study of Crohn's disease prognosis, four regions remain associated at genome-wide significance but with increased standard errors.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure with a strong familial component. We performed an exome-wide array-based association study (EWAS) to assess the contribution of missense variants to sporadic DCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: 116,855 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were analyzed in 2796 DCM patients and 6877 control subjects from 6 populations of European ancestry. We confirmed two previously identified associations with SNVs in BAG3 and ZBTB17 and discovered six novel DCM-associated loci (Q-value{$<$}0.01). The lead-SNVs at novel loci are common and located in TTN, SLC39A8, MLIP, FLNC, ALPK3 and FHOD3. In silico fine mapping identified HSPB7 as the most likely candidate at the ZBTB17 locus. Rare variant analysis (MAF{$<$}0.01) demonstrated significant association for TTN variants only (P = 0.0085). All candidate genes but one (SLC39A8) exhibit preferential expression in striated muscle tissues and mutations in TTN, BAG3, FLNC and FHOD3 are known to cause familial cardiomyopathy. We also investigated a panel of 48 known cardiomyopathy genes. Collectively, rare (n = 228, P = 0.0033) or common (n = 36, P = 0.019) variants with elevated in silico severity scores were associated with DCM, indicating that the spectrum of genes contributing to sporadic DCM extends beyond those identified here. CONCLUSION: We identified eight loci independently associated with sporadic DCM. The functions of the best candidate genes at these loci suggest that proteostasis regulation might play a role in DCM pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subclinical inflammation is associated with an increased risk of heart failure and with adverse prognosis in patients with established heart failure. Yet, treatments specifically directed at reducing inflammation in patients with heart failure have not yet shown improved clinical outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that the interleukin-1{$\beta$} inhibitor canakinumab would prevent hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and the composite of HHF or heart failure-related mortality. METHODS: We randomized 10\,061 patients with prior myocardial infarction and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein {$\geq$}2 mg/L to canakinumab 50, 150, or 300 mg or placebo, given subcutaneously once every 3 months. In total, 2173 (22\%) reported a history of heart failure at baseline. We tested the hypothesis that canakinumab prevents prospectively collected HHF events and the composite of HHF or heart failure-related mortality. RESULTS: A total of 385 patients had an HHF event during a median follow-up of 3.7 years. Patients who had HHF were older, had higher body mass index, and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prior coronary bypass surgery. As anticipated, median (quartile 1, 3) baseline concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were higher among those who had HHF during follow-up than those who did not (5.7 [3.5, 9.9] mg/L versus 4.2 [2.8, 6.9] mg/L, respectively; P{$<$}0.0001). The unadjusted hazard ratios for HHF with each dose of canakinumab compared with placebo were 1.04 (95\% CI, 0.79-1.36) for 50 mg, 0.86 (95\% CI, 0.65-1.13) for 150 mg, and 0.76 (95\% CI, 0.57-1.01) for 300 mg ( P for trend=0.025). The composite of HHF or heart failure-related mortality was also reduced by canakinumab, with unadjusted hazard ratios of 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.78-1.29) for 50 mg, 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.68-1.13) for 150 mg, and 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.60-1.02) for 300 mg ( P for trend=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: These randomized double-blind placebo-controlled data suggest that therapy with canakinumab, an interleukin-1{$\beta$} inhibitor, is related to a dose-dependent reduction in HHF and the composite of HHF or heart failure-related mortality in a population of patients with prior myocardial infarction and elevations in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

  abstract = {During meiosis, at least one crossover must occur per homologous chromosome pair to ensure normal progression of meiotic division and accurate chromosome segregation. However, the mechanism of crossover formation is not fully understood. Here, we report a novel recombination protein, C12ORF40/REDIC1, essential for meiotic crossover formation in mammals. A homozygous frameshift mutation in C12orf40 (c.232\_233insTT, p.Met78Ilefs*2) was identified in two infertile men with meiotic arrest. Spread mouse spermatocyte fluorescence immunostaining showed that REDIC1 forms discrete foci between the paired regions of homologous chromosomes depending on strand invasion and colocalizes with MSH4 and later with MLH1 at the crossover sites. Redic1 knock-in (KI) mice homozygous for mutation c.232\_233insTT are infertile in both sexes due to insufficient crossovers and consequent meiotic arrest, which is also observed in our patients. The foci of MSH4 and TEX11, markers of recombination intermediates, are significantly reduced numerically in the spermatocytes of Redic1 KI mice. More importantly, our biochemical results show that the N-terminus of REDIC1 binds branched DNAs present in recombination intermediates, while the identified mutation impairs this interaction. Thus, our findings reveal a crucial role for C12ORF40/REDIC1 in meiotic crossover formation by stabilizing the recombination intermediates, providing prospective molecular targets for the clinical diagnosis and therapy of infertility.},

Approximately 9.2 million individuals aged 40-69 years who lived within 25 miles (40 km) of one of 22 assessment centers in England, Wales, and Scotland were invited to enter the cohort, and 5.5\% participated in the baseline assessment. The representativeness of the UK Biobank cohort was investigated by comparing demographic characteristics between nonresponders and responders. Sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics of the cohort were compared with nationally representative data sources. UK Biobank participants were more likely to be older, to be female, and to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas than nonparticipants. Compared with the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke, and to drink alcohol on a daily basis and had fewer self-reported health conditions. At age 70-74 years, rates of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence were 46.2\% and 11.8\% lower, respectively, in men and 55.5\% and 18.1\% lower, respectively, in women than in the general population of the same age. UK Biobank is not representative of the sampling population; there is evidence of a "healthy volunteer" selection bias. Nonetheless, valid assessment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be representative of the population at large.},

  abstract = {Genetic alterations in the LRRK2 gene, encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, are a common risk factor for Parkinson's disease. How LRRK2 alterations lead to cell pathology is an area of ongoing investigation, however, multiple lines of evidence suggest a role for LRRK2 in lipid pathways. It is increasingly recognized that in addition to being energy reservoirs and structural entities, some lipids, including neural lipids, participate in signaling cascades. Early investigations revealed that LRRK2 localized to membranous and vesicular structures, suggesting an interaction of LRRK2 and lipids or lipid-associated proteins. LRRK2 substrates from the Rab GTPase family play a critical role in vesicle trafficking, lipid metabolism and lipid storage, all processes which rely on lipid dynamics. In addition, LRRK2 is associated with the phosphorylation and activity of enzymes that catabolize plasma membrane and lysosomal lipids. Furthermore, LRRK2 knockout studies have revealed that blood, brain and urine exhibit lipid level changes, including alterations to sterols, sphingolipids and phospholipids, respectively. In human LRRK2 mutation carriers, changes to sterols, sphingolipids, phospholipids, fatty acyls and glycerolipids are reported in multiple tissues. This review summarizes the evidence regarding associations between LRRK2 and lipids, and the functional consequences of LRRK2-associated lipid changes are discussed.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Our objective was to better understand the genetic bases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a leading cause of systolic heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted the largest genome-wide association study performed so far in DCM, with 2719 cases and 4440 controls in the discovery population. We identified and replicated two new DCM-associated loci on chromosome 3p25.1 [lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs62232870, P\,=\,8.7 {\texttimes} 10-11 and 7.7 {\texttimes} 10-4 in the discovery and replication steps, respectively] and chromosome 22q11.23 (lead SNP rs7284877, P\,=\,3.3 {\texttimes} 10-8 and 1.4 {\texttimes} 10-3 in the discovery and replication steps, respectively), while confirming two previously identified DCM loci on chromosomes 10 and 1, BAG3 and HSPB7. A genetic risk score constructed from the number of risk alleles at these four DCM loci revealed a 3-fold increased risk of DCM for individuals with 8 risk alleles compared to individuals with 5 risk alleles (median of the referral population). In silico annotation and functional 4C-sequencing analyses on iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes identify SLC6A6 as the most likely DCM gene at the 3p25.1 locus. This gene encodes a taurine transporter whose involvement in myocardial dysfunction and DCM is supported by numerous observations in humans and animals. At the 22q11.23 locus, in silico and data mining annotations, and to a lesser extent functional analysis, strongly suggest SMARCB1 as the candidate culprit gene. CONCLUSION: This study provides a better understanding of the genetic architecture of DCM and sheds light on novel biological pathways underlying heart failure.},

  abstract = {Selection bias affects Mendelian randomization investigations when selection into the study sample depends on a collider between the genetic variant and confounders of the risk factor--outcome association. However, the relative importance of selection bias for Mendelian randomization compared with other potential biases is unclear.We performed an extensive simulation study to assess the impact of selection bias on a typical Mendelian randomization investigation. We considered inverse probability weighting as a potential method for reducing selection bias. Finally, we investigated whether selection bias may explain a recently reported finding that lipoprotein(a) is not a causal risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in individuals with previous coronary heart disease.Selection bias had a severe impact on bias and Type 1 error rates in our simulation study, but only when selection effects were large. For moderate effects of the risk factor on selection, bias was generally small and Type 1 error rate inflation was not considerable. Inverse probability weighting ameliorated bias when the selection model was correctly specified, but increased bias when selection bias was moderate and the model was misspecified. In the example of lipoprotein(a), strong genetic associations and strong confounder effects on selection mean the reported null effect on cardiovascular mortality could plausibly be explained by selection bias.Selection bias can adversely affect Mendelian randomization investigations, but its impact is likely to be less than other biases. Selection bias is substantial when the effects of the risk factor and confounders on selection are particularly large.},

However, the definition of its genetic architecture is limited by the technical challenge of capturing dynamic flow volumes from cardiac imaging at scale. We present DeepFlow, a deep-learning system to extract cardiac flow and volumes from phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A mixed-linear model applied to 37,653 individuals from the UK Biobank reveals genome-wide significant associations across cardiac dynamic flow volumes spanning from aortic forward velocity to aortic regurgitation fraction. Mendelian randomization reveals a causal role for aortic root size in aortic valve regurgitation. Among the most significant contributing variants, localizing genes (near ELN, PRDM6 and ADAMTS7) are implicated in connective tissue and blood pressure pathways. Here we show that DeepFlow cardiac flow phenotyping at scale, combined with genotyping data, reinforces the contribution of connective tissue genes, blood pressure and root size to aortic valve function.},

  abstract = {Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reflects kidney function. Progressive eGFR-decline can lead to kidney failure, necessitating dialysis or transplantation. Hundreds of loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for eGFR help explain population cross section variability. Since the contribution of these or other loci to eGFR-decline remains largely unknown, we derived GWAS for annual eGFR-decline and meta-analyzed 62 longitudinal studies with eGFR assessed twice over time in all 343,339 individuals and in high-risk groups. We also explored different covariate adjustment. Twelve genome-wide significant independent variants for eGFR-decline unadjusted or adjusted for eGFR-baseline (11 novel, one known for this phenotype), including nine variants robustly associated across models were identified. All loci for eGFR-decline were known for cross-sectional eGFR and thus distinguished a subgroup of eGFR loci. Seven of the nine variants showed variant-by-age interaction on eGFR cross section (further about 350,000 individuals), which linked genetic associations for eGFR-decline with age-dependency of genetic cross-section associations. Clinically important were two to four-fold greater genetic effects on eGFR-decline in high-risk subgroups. Five variants associated also with chronic kidney disease progression mapped to genes with functional in-silico evidence (UMOD, SPATA7, GALNTL5, TPPP). An unfavorable versus favorable nine-variant genetic profile showed increased risk odds ratios of 1.35 for kidney failure (95\% confidence intervals 1.03-1.77) and 1.27 for acute kidney injury (95\% confidence intervals 1.08-1.50) in over 2000 cases each, with matched controls). Thus, we provide a large data resource, genetic loci, and prioritized genes for kidney function decline, which help inform drug development pipelines revealing important insights into the age-dependency of kidney function genetics.},

A substantial proportion of patients, however, experience no benefit from ACE inhibitors because of previous intolerance. We aimed to find out whether candesartan, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, could improve outcome in such patients not taking an ACE inhibitor. METHODS: Between March, 1999, and March, 2001, we enrolled 2028 patients with symptomatic heart failure and left-ventricular ejection fraction 40\% or less who were not receiving ACE inhibitors because of previous intolerance. Patients were randomly assigned candesartan (target dose 32 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The primary outcome of the study was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for CHF. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: The most common manifestation of ACE-inhibitor intolerance was cough (72\%), followed by symptomatic hypotension (13\%) and renal dysfunction (12\%). During a median follow-up of 33.7 months, 334 (33\%) of 1013 patients in the candesartan group and 406 (40\%) of 1015 in the placebo group had cardiovascular death or hospital admission for CHF (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.77 [95\% CI 0.67-0.89], p=0.0004; covariate adjusted 0.70 [0.60-0.81], p{$<$}0.0001). Each component of the primary outcome was reduced, as was the total number of hospital admissions for CHF. Study-drug discontinuation rates were similar in the candesartan (30\%) and placebo (29\%) groups. INTERPRETATION: Candesartan was generally well tolerated and reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure and intolerance to ACE inhibitors.},

  abstract = {We have shown that 14q32 microRNAs are highly involved in vascular remodelling and cardiovascular disease. However, the 14q32 locus also encodes 41 `orphan' small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). We aimed to gather evidence for an independent role for 14q32 snoRNAs in human cardiovascular disease.We performed a lookup of the 14q32 region within the dataset of a genome wide association scan in 5244 participants of the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the snoRNA-cluster were significantly associated with heart failure. These snoRNA-cluster SNPs were not linked to SNPs in the microRNA-cluster or in MEG3, indicating that snoRNAs modify the risk of cardiovascular disease independently. We looked at expression of 14q32 snoRNAs throughout the human cardio-vasculature. Expression profiles of the 14q32 snoRNAs appeared highly vessel specific. When we compared expression levels of 14q32 snoRNAs in human vena saphena magna (VSM) with those in failed VSM-coronary bypasses, we found that 14q32 snoRNAs were up-regulated. SNORD113.2, which showed a 17-fold up-regulation in failed bypasses, was also up-regulated two-fold in plasma samples drawn from patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction directly after hospitalization compared with 30\,days after start of treatment. However, fitting with the genomic associations, 14q32 snoRNA expression was highest in failing human hearts. In vitro studies show that the 14q32 snoRNAs bind predominantly to methyl-transferase Fibrillarin, indicating that they act through canonical mechanisms, but on non-canonical RNA targets. The canonical C/D-box snoRNA seed sequences were highly conserved between humans and mice.14q32 snoRNAs appear to play an independent role in cardiovascular pathology. 14q32 snoRNAs are specifically regulated throughout the human vasculature and their expression is up-regulated during cardiovascular disease. Our data demonstrate that snoRNAs merit increased effort and attention in future basic and clinical cardiovascular research.},

  abstract = {Heart failure exhibits remarkable pathophysiologic heterogeneity. A large body of evidence suggests that regardless of the underlying etiology, heart failure is associated with induction of cytokines and chemokines that may contribute to the pathogenesis of adverse remodeling, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{$\alpha$}, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 have been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Inflammatory cytokines modulate phenotype and function of all myocardial cells, suppressing contractile function in cardiomyocytes, inducing inflammatory activation in macrophages, stimulating microvascular inflammation and dysfunction, and promoting a matrix-degrading phenotype in fibroblasts. Moreover, cytokine-induced growth factor synthesis may exert chronic fibrogenic actions contributing to the pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In addition to their role in adverse cardiac remodeling, some inflammatory cytokines may also exert protective actions on cardiomyocytes under conditions of stress. Chemokines, such as CCL2, are also upregulated in failing hearts and may stimulate recruitment of pro-inflammatory leukocytes, promoting myocardial injury, fibrotic remodeling, and dysfunction. Although experimental evidence suggests that cytokine and chemokine targeting may hold therapeutic promise in heart failure, clinical translation remains challenging. This review manuscript summarizes our knowledge on the role of TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1, IL-6, and CCL2 in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and discusses the promises and challenges of targeted anti-cytokine therapy. Dissection of protective and maladaptive cellular actions of cytokines in the failing heart, and identification of patient subsets with overactive or dysregulated myocardial inflammatory responses are required for design of successful therapeutic approaches.},

Conventional analyses of this relationship are susceptible to omitted variable bias from variables that jointly influence both hospital admission and adipose status. We implement a novel quasi-Poisson instrumental variable model in a Mendelian randomization framework, identifying causal effects from random perturbations to germline genetic variation. We estimate the individual and joint effects of BMI, WHR, and WHR adjusted for BMI. We also implement multivariable instrumental variable methods in which the causal effect of one exposure is estimated conditionally on the causal effect of another exposure. Data on 310,471 participants and over 550,000 inpatient admissions in the UK Biobank were used to perform one-sample and two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses. The results supported a causal role of adiposity on hospital admissions, with consistency across all estimates and sensitivity analyses. Point estimates were generally larger than estimates from comparable observational specifications. We observed an attenuation of the BMI effect when adjusting for WHR in the multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses, suggesting that an adverse fat distribution, rather than a higher BMI itself, may drive the relationship between adiposity and risk of hospital admission.},

  abstract = {Background--- Blood pressure (BP) responses to dietary sodium and potassium intervention and cold pressor test vary considerably among individuals. We aimed to identify novel genetic variants influencing individuals' BP responses to dietary intervention and cold pressor test. Methods and Results--- We conducted a genome-wide association study of BP responses in 1881 Han Chinese and de novo genotyped top findings in 698 Han Chinese. Diet-feeding study included a 7-day low-sodium (51.3 mmol/d), a 7-day high-sodium (307.8 mmol/d), and a 7-day high-sodium plus potassium supplementation (60 mmol/d). Nine BP measurements were obtained during baseline observation and each intervention period. The meta-analyses identified 8 novel loci for BP phenotypes, which physically mapped in or near PRMT6 (P=7.29{\texttimes}10--9), CDCA7 (P=3.57{\texttimes}10--8), PIBF1 (P=1.78{\texttimes}10--9), ARL4C (P=1.86{\texttimes}10--8), IRAK1BP1 (P=1.44{\texttimes}10-10), SALL1 (P=7.01{\texttimes}10--13), TRPM8 (P=2.68{\texttimes}10--8), and FBXL13 (P=3.74{\texttimes}10--9). There was a strong dose--response relationship between the number of risk alleles of these independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the risk of developing hypertension during the 7.5-year follow-up in the study participants. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of risk alleles, odds ratios (95\% confidence intervals) for those in the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 1.39 (0.97, 1.99), 1.72 (1.19, 2.47), and 1.84 (1.29, 2.62), respectively (P=0.0003 for trend). Conclusions--- Our study identified 8 novel loci for BP responses to dietary sodium and potassium intervention and cold pressor test. The effect size of these novel loci on BP phenotypes is much larger than those reported by the previously published studies. Furthermore, these variants predict the risk of developing hypertension among individuals with normal BP at baseline.},

However, the impact, interplay, and underlying biological mechanisms among BMI, environment, genetics, and ancestry are not completely understood. To further examine these relationships, we utilized 427,509 calendar year-averaged BMI measurements from 100,418 adults from the single large multiethnic Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We observed substantial independent ancestry and nationality differences, including ancestry principal component interactions and nonlinear effects. To increase the list of BMI-associated variants before assessing other differences, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in GERA, with replication in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropomorphic Traits (GIANT) consortium combined with the UK Biobank (UKB), followed by GWAS in GERA combined with GIANT, with replication in the UKB. We discovered 30 novel independent BMI loci (P {$<$} 5.0 {\texttimes} 10-8) that replicated. We then assessed the proportion of BMI variance explained by sex in the UKB using previously identified loci compared to previously and newly identified loci and found slight increases: from 3.0 to 3.3\% for males and from 2.7 to 3.0\% for females. Further, the variance explained by previously and newly identified variants decreased with increasing age in the GERA and UKB cohorts, echoed in the variance explained by the entire genome, which also showed gene-age interaction effects. Finally, we conducted a tissue expression QTL enrichment analysis, which revealed that GWAS BMI-associated variants were enriched in the cerebellum, consistent with prior work in humans and mice.},

The mechanisms that uncouple adiposity from its cardiometabolic complications are not fully understood. Here, we identify 62 loci of which the same allele is significantly associated with both higher adiposity and lower cardiometabolic risk. Functional analyses show that the 62 loci are enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue, and for regulatory variants that influence nearby genes that affect adipocyte differentiation. Genes prioritized in each locus support a key role of fat distribution (FAM13A, IRS1 and PPARG) and adipocyte function (ALDH2, CCDC92, DNAH10, ESR1, FAM13A, MTOR, PIK3R1 and VEGFB). Several additional mechanisms are involved as well, such as insulin--glucose signalling (ADCY5, ARAP1, CREBBP, FAM13A, MTOR, PEPD, RAC1 and SH2B3), energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation (IGF2BP2), browning of white adipose tissue (CSK, VEGFA, VEGFB and SLC22A3) and inflammation (SH2B3, DAGLB and ADCY9). Some of these genes may represent therapeutic targets to reduce cardiometabolic risk linked to excess adiposity.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly recruited 459 white European subjects from 52 families (50\% women; mean age 45 years). LV structure was measured by M-mode and 2D echocardiography and LV function was measured by conventional Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Other measurements included blood pressure, anthropometric, and biochemical measurements. We estimated the heritability of LV traits while adjusting for covariables, including sex, age, body height and weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart rate. With full adjustment, heritability of LV mass was 0.23 (P= 0.025). The TDI-derived mitral annular velocities Ea and Aa showed moderate heritability (h(2)= 0.36 and 0.53, respectively), whereas the mitral inflow A peak had weak heritability (h(2) = 0.25) and the E peak was not heritable (h(2) = 0.11). We partitioned the total phenotypic correlation when it reached significance, into a genetic and an environmental component. The genetic correlations were 0.61 between the E and Ea peaks and 0.90 between the A and Aa peaks. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated moderate heritability for LV mass as well as the mitral annular Ea and Aa peaks. We also found significant genetic correlations between the E and Ea peaks and between the A and Aa peaks. Our current findings support the ongoing research to map and detect genetic variants that contribute to the variation in LV mass and other LV structural and functional phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Background The rate of disease progression is an important factor to consider regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD), as people with a rapid decline are considerably more likely to require additional care resources. The rate of progression in AD has been found to vary widely between individuals, with numerous factors driving this heterogeneity. In this project, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to investigate the presence of a genetic liability to faster progression in patients with AD. Methods A subset of 543 individuals with AD from the Cardiff MRC centre cohorts that have been assessed at multiple timepoints was used in this analysis. A progression score for each individual was approximated by a random slope from a random effects regression model of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) using all available MMSE measurements. The score was subsequently used in a GWAS of progression. Quality control analysis was performed following standard GWAS protocols resulting in 304,448 variants to be included in the analysis. Results The sample was 67.37\% female, with mean age at recruitment being 80.2 years. Mean MMSE was 17.03 at first assessment and 11.54 at last assessment, and mean number of assessments was 3.16. After correcting for multiple testing, no variant was found to be significantly associated with progression in this GWAS. Furthermore, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was not associated with progression. Conclusion Preliminary results show that, after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, no variant was significantly associated with progression in AD. Suggestive associated variants were found in chromosome 20:5843812 (p-value = 3.12 {\texttimes} 10-7), 1:62271962 (p-value = 6.30 {\texttimes} 10-7), 10:15452800 (p-value = 1.65 {\texttimes} 10-6) and 5:117646945 (p-value = 2.40 {\texttimes} 10-6). Moreover, ApoE genotype was not found to affect the rate progression, the lowest p-value in the ApoE region (19:44905791 - 19:44909393) being 0.23. This non-significant result might indicate that the genetic risk for accelerated cognitive decline within AD is separate from the genetic risk for developing AD. The sample size is one of the main limitations of this study. Replication in a larger dataset is necessary in order to validate these findings and uncover the presence of genetic variants that affect the rate of decline in AD.},

However, in patients with certain specific chronic diseases, including heart failure, low BMI has been associated with increased mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the influence of BMI on prognosis using Cox proportional hazards models in 7599 patients (mean age, 65 years; 35\% women) with symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II to IV) and a broad spectrum of left ventricular ejection fractions (mean, 39\%) in the Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) program. During a median follow-up of 37.7 months, 1831 patients died. After adjustment for potential confounders, compared with patients with BMI between 30 and 34.9, patients in lower BMI categories had a graded increase in the risk of death. The hazard ratios (95\% confidence intervals) were 1.22 (1.06 to 1.41), 1.46 (1.24 to 1.71), and 1.69 (1.43 to 2.01) among those with BMI of 25 to 29.9, 22.5 to 24.9, and {$<$} 22.5, respectively. The increase in risk of death among patients with BMI {$>$} or = 35 was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95\% confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.43). The association between BMI and mortality was not altered by age, smoking status, or left ventricular ejection fraction (P for interaction {$>$}0.20). However, lower BMI was associated with a greater risk of all-cause death in patients without edema but not in patients with edema (P for interaction {$<$}0.0001). Lower BMI was associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular death and noncardiovascular death. Baseline BMI did not influence the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure or due to all causes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic heart failure and either reduced or preserved left ventricular systolic function, underweight or low BMI was associated with increased mortality, primarily in patients without evidence of fluid overload (edema).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extreme obesity is recognized to be a risk factor for heart failure. It is unclear whether overweight and lesser degrees of obesity also pose a risk. METHODS: We investigated the relation between the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and the incidence of heart failure among 5881 participants in the Framingham Heart Study (mean age, 55 years; 54 percent women). With the use of Cox proportional-hazards models, the body-mass index was evaluated both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable (normal, 18.5 to 24.9; overweight, 25.0 to 29.9; and obese, 30.0 or more). RESULTS: During follow-up (mean, 14 years), heart failure developed in 496 subjects (258 women and 238 men). After adjustment for established risk factors, there was an increase in the risk of heart failure of 5 percent for men and 7 percent for women for each increment of 1 in body-mass index. As compared with subjects with a normal body-mass index, obese subjects had a doubling of the risk of heart failure. For women, the hazard ratio was 2.12 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.51 to 2.97); for men, the hazard ratio was 1.90 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.30 to 2.79). A graded increase in the risk of heart failure was observed across categories of body-mass index. The hazard ratios per increase in category were 1.46 in women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.72) and 1.37 in men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.67). CONCLUSIONS: In our large, community-based sample, increased body-mass index was associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Given the high prevalence of obesity in the United States, strategies to promote optimal body weight may reduce the population burden of heart failure.},

  abstract = {AIMS: A network meta-analysis (NMA) of all recommended drug groups for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), including their combinations, was performed to assess the relative efficacy and incremental benefit. METHODS AND RESULTS: A search was made in biomedical databases for randomized controlled trials published between 1987 and 2017 on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), ivabradine (IVA), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI). A total of 58 relevant trials were identified. The relative efficacy of each treatment group (or combination) in terms of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause hospitalizations and hospitalizations for heart failure, per patient-year of follow-up, were combined in a random-effects Bayesian NMA. The pairwise comparison between each regimen and for each outcome was estimated. The NMA was dominated by 15 large-scale trials with between 1984 and 18\,898 patient-years of follow-up. Combinations of drug groups showed incremental benefits on outcomes over single groups. The most effective combinations were ARNI+BB\,+\,MRA and ACEI+BB\,+\,MRA\,+\,IVA, showing reductions in all-cause mortality (vs. placebo) of 62\% and 59\%, respectively; hazard ratios were 0.38 [credible interval (CrI) 0.20-0.65] and 0.41 (CrI 0.21-0.70); and in all-cause hospitalizations with reductions of 42\% for both. These two combinations were also the most effective for the other outcomes studied. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that the incremental use of combinations of disease-modifying therapies has resulted in the progressive improvement in mortality and hospitalization outcomes in HFrEF. Our findings support the current guideline recommendations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists differ in their structure and duration of action and have been studied in trials of varying sizes and with different patient populations, with inconsistent effects on cardiovascular outcomes reported. We aimed to synthesise the available evidence by doing a systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials of these drugs. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for eligible placebo-controlled trials reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; ie, cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction) up to June 15, 2019. We did a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to estimate overall hazard ratios (HRs) for MACE, its components, death from any cause, hospital admission for heart failure, kidney outcomes, and key safety outcomes (severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer). We also examined MACE in several subgroups based on patient characteristics (history of cardiovascular disease, BMI, age, baseline HbA1c, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate), trial duration, treatment dosing interval, and structural homology. FINDINGS: Of 27 publications screened, seven trials, with a combined total of 56\hphantom{,}004 participants, were included: ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide), EXSCEL (exenatide), Harmony Outcomes (albiglutide), REWIND (dulaglutide), and PIONEER 6 (oral semaglutide). Overall, GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment reduced MACE by 12\% (HR 0{$\cdot$}88, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}82-0{$\cdot$}94; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity across the subgroups examined. HRs were 0{$\cdot$}88 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}81-0{$\cdot$}96; p=0{$\cdot$}003) for death from cardiovascular causes, 0{$\cdot$}84 (0{$\cdot$}76-0{$\cdot$}93; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) for fatal or non-fatal stroke, and 0{$\cdot$}91 (0{$\cdot$}84-1{$\cdot$}00; p=0{$\cdot$}043) for fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction. GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment reduced all-cause mortality by 12\% (0{$\cdot$}88, 0{$\cdot$}83-0{$\cdot$}95; p=0{$\cdot$}001), hospital admission for heart failure by 9\% (0{$\cdot$}91, 0{$\cdot$}83-0{$\cdot$}99; p=0{$\cdot$}028), and a broad composite kidney outcome (development of new-onset macroalbuminuria, decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [or increase in creatinine], progression to end-stage kidney disease, or death attributable to kidney causes) by 17\% (0{$\cdot$}83, 0{$\cdot$}78-0{$\cdot$}89; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), mainly due to a reduction in urinary albumin excretion. There was no increase in risk of severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists has beneficial effects on cardiovascular, mortality, and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. FUNDING: None.},

METHODS: We examined the cross-sectional association of heart failure in parents with the prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as well as left ventricular mass, internal dimensions, and wall thickness, in 1497 participants of the Framingham Offspring Study (mean age, 57 years; 819 women) who underwent routine echocardiography. We also investigated prospectively whether heart failure in parents increased the risk of heart failure in 2214 offspring (mean age, 44 years; 1150 women). RESULTS: As compared with the 1039 participants whose parents did not have heart failure, the 458 participants in the cross-sectional cohort who had at least one parent with heart failure were more likely to have increased left ventricular mass (17.0 percent vs. 26.9 percent), left ventricular internal dimensions (18.6 percent vs. 23.4 percent), and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (3.1 percent vs. 5.7 percent); the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios were 1.35 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.84), 1.29 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.72), and 2.37 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 4.61), respectively. In the longitudinal cohort, heart failure developed in 90 offspring during follow-up (mean length of follow-up, 20 years). The age- and sex-adjusted 10-year incidence rates of heart failure were 2.72 percent among offspring with a parent with heart failure, as compared with 1.62 percent among those without a parent with heart failure. This increase in risk persisted after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.60). CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure in parents is associated with an increased prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction cross-sectionally and an elevated risk of heart failure longitudinally. Our data emphasize the contribution of familial factors to the heart-failure burden in the community.},

  abstract = {Heart failure is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the contribution of common genetic variation to heart failure risk has not been fully elucidated, particularly in comparison to other common cardiometabolic traits. We report a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study meta-analysis of all-cause heart failure including up to 115,150 cases and 1,550,331 controls of diverse genetic ancestry, identifying 47 risk loci. We also perform multivariate genome-wide association studies that integrate heart failure with related cardiac magnetic resonance imaging endophenotypes, identifying 61 risk loci. Gene-prioritization analyses including colocalization and transcriptome-wide association studies identify known and previously unreported candidate cardiomyopathy genes and cellular processes, which we validate in gene-expression profiling of failing and healthy human hearts. Colocalization, gene expression profiling, and Mendelian randomization provide convergent evidence for the roles of BCKDHA and circulating branch-chain amino acids in heart failure and cardiac structure. Finally, proteome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies 9 circulating proteins associated with heart failure or quantitative imaging traits. These analyses highlight similarities and differences among heart failure and associated cardiovascular imaging endophenotypes, implicate common genetic variation in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and identify circulating proteins that may represent cardiomyopathy treatment targets.},

A greater understanding of the in~vivo human processes involved, and in particular, which are the causes and which are the downstream effects, may allow the syndrome of HFpEF to be distilled into distinct diagnoses based on the underlying biology. From this, specific interventions can follow, targeting individuals identified on the basis of their biological phenotype.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Iron deficiency is present in approximately 50\% of patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and is an independent predictor of reduced functional capacity and mortality. However, the efficacy of inexpensive readily available oral iron supplementation in heart failure is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To test whether therapy with oral iron improves peak exercise capacity in patients with HFrEF and iron deficiency. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of patients with HFrEF ({$<$}40\%) and iron deficiency, defined as a serum ferritin level of 15 to 100 ng/mL or a serum ferritin level of 101 to 299 ng/mL with transferrin saturation of less than 20\%. Participants were enrolled between September 2014 and November 2015 at 23 US sites. INTERVENTIONS: Oral iron polysaccharide (n\,=\,111) or placebo (n\,=\,114), 150 mg twice daily for 16 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was a change in peak oxygen uptake ({\.V}o2) from baseline to 16 weeks. Secondary end points were change in 6-minute walk distance, plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, and health status as assessed by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ, range 0-100, higher scores reflect better quality of life). RESULTS: Among 225 randomized participants (median age, 63 years; 36\% women) 203 completed the study. The median baseline peak {\.V}o2 was 1196 mL/min (interquartile range [IQR], 887-1448 mL/min) in the oral iron group and 1167 mL/min (IQR, 887-1449 mL/min) in the placebo group. The primary end point, change in peak {\.V}o2 at 16 weeks, did not significantly differ between the oral iron and placebo groups (+23 mL/min vs -2 mL/min; difference, 21 mL/min [95\% CI, -34 to +76 mL/min]; P\,=\,.46). Similarly, at 16 weeks, there were no significant differences between treatment groups in changes in 6-minute walk distance (-13 m; 95\% CI, -32 to 6 m), NT-proBNP levels (159; 95\% CI, -280 to 599 pg/mL), or KCCQ score (1; 95\% CI, -2.4 to 4.4), all P\,{$>$}\,.05. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among participants with HFrEF with iron deficiency, high-dose oral iron did not improve exercise capacity over 16 weeks. These results do not support use of oral iron supplementation in patients with HFrEF. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02188784.},

  abstract = {A key driver of patients' well-being and clinical trials for Parkinson's disease (PD) is the course that the disease takes over time (progression and prognosis). To assess how genetic variation influences the progression of PD over time to dementia, a major determinant for quality of life, we performed a longitudinal genome-wide survival study of 11.2 million variants in 3,821 patients with PD over 31,053 visits. We discover RIMS2 as a progression locus and confirm this in a replicate population (hazard ratio (HR)\,=\,4.77, P\,=\,2.78\,{\texttimes}\,10-11), identify suggestive evidence for TMEM108 (HR\,=\,2.86, P\,=\,2.09\,{\texttimes}\,10-8) and WWOX (HR\,=\,2.12, P\,=\,2.37\,{\texttimes}\,10-8) as progression loci, and confirm associations for GBA (HR\,=\,1.93, P\,=\,0.0002) and APOE (HR\,=\,1.48, P\,=\,0.001). Polygenic progression scores exhibit a substantial aggregate association with dementia risk, while polygenic susceptibility scores are not predictive. This study identifies a novel synaptic locus and polygenic score for cognitive disease progression in PD and proposes diverging genetic architectures of progression and susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {$<$} 5 {\texttimes} 10-8), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for {\textasciitilde}2.7\% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {$>$}20\% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of common HF risk factors as potential mediators. Methods and Results Electronic health record data from primary care, hospital admissions and death registrations in England were used to perform an observational analysis. Data for 1.5 million individuals aged {$\geq$}18 years, with BMI measurements and free from heart failure at baseline, were included between 1998 and 2016. Cox models were used to estimate the association between BMI and HF with and without adjustment for atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD), and hypertension (HTN). Univariable and multivariable two-sample Mendelian randomisation was performed to estimate causal effects.Among non-underweight individuals, BMI was positively associated with HF with a 1-SD ({$\sim$} 4.8kg/m2) higher BMI associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.31 (1.30, 1.32). Genetically predicted BMI yielded a causal odds ratio (OR) of 1.64 per 4.8 kg/m2 BMI (1.58, 1.70) which attenuated by 41\% (to OR of 1.38 (95\% CI 1.31-1.45), when simultaneously accounting for AF, DM, CHD and SBP. Conclusion About 40\% of the excess risk of HF due to adiposity is driven by SBP, AF, DM and CHD. These findings highlight the importance of the prevention and treatment of excess adiposity and downstream HF risk factors to prevent HF, even in people in whom the above risk factors are well managed. One-sentence summary This study of the role of excess adiposity as a risk factor for HF, including an observational analysis of measured BMI 1.5 million individuals and multivariable MR analysis of genetically elevated BMI, provides evidence that adiposity is causally associated with HF, with approximately 40\% of the effect being mediated by conventional risk pathways.},

We propose a method, `Slope-Hunter', that uses model-based clustering to identify and utilise the class of variants only affecting the phenotype to estimate the adjustment factor, assuming this class explains more variation in the phenotype than any other variant classes. Simulation studies show that our approach eliminates the bias and outperforms alternatives even in the presence of genetic correlation. In a study of fasting blood insulin levels (FI) conditional on body mass index, we eliminate paradoxical associations of the underweight loci: COBLLI; PPARG with increased FI, and reveal an association for the locus rs1421085 (FTO). In an analysis of a case-only study for breast cancer mortality, a single region remains associated with more pronounced results.},

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists have shown cardioprotective effects in early clinical studies of patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status.To test whether therapy with a GLP-1 agonist improves clinical stability following hospitalization for acute heart failure.Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of patients with established heart failure and reduced LVEF who were recently hospitalized. Patients were enrolled between August 2013 and March 2015 at 24 US sites.The GLP-1 agonist liraglutide (n\,=\,154) or placebo (n\,=\,146) via a daily subcutaneous injection; study drug was advanced to a dosage of 1.8 mg/d during the first 30 days as tolerated and continued for 180 days.The primary end point was a global rank score in which all patients, regardless of treatment assignment, were ranked across 3 hierarchical tiers: time to death, time to rehospitalization for heart failure, and time-averaged proportional change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level from baseline to 180 days. Higher values indicate better health (stability). Exploratory secondary outcomes included primary end point components, cardiac structure and function, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, and combined events.Among the 300 patients who were randomized (median age, 61 years [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 52-68 years]; 64 [21\%] women; 178 [59\%] with type 2 diabetes; median LVEF of 25\% [IQR, 19\%-33\%]; median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2049 pg/mL [IQR, 1054-4235 pg/mL]), 271 completed the study. Compared with placebo, liraglutide had no significant effect on the primary end point (mean rank of 146 for the liraglutide group vs 156 for the placebo group, P\,=\,.31). There were no significant between-group differences in the number of deaths (19 [12\%] in the liraglutide group vs 16 [11\%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 1.10 [95\% CI, 0.57-2.14]; P\,=\,.78) or rehospitalizations for heart failure (63 [41\%] vs 50 [34\%], respectively; hazard ratio, 1.30 [95\% CI, 0.89-1.88]; P\,=\,.17) or for the exploratory secondary end points. Prespecified subgroup analyses in patients with diabetes did not reveal any significant between-group differences. The number of investigator-reported hyperglycemic events was 16 (10\%) in the liraglutide group vs 27 (18\%) in the placebo group and hypoglycemic events were infrequent (2 [1\%] vs 4 [3\%], respectively). Among patients recently hospitalized with heart failure and reduced LVEF, the use of liraglutide did not lead to greater posthospitalization clinical stability. These findings do not support the use of liraglutide in this clinical situation.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01800968},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives The genetic basis of Parkinson disease (PD) motor progression is largely unknown. Previous studies of the genetics of PD progression have included small cohorts and shown a limited overlap with genetic PD risk factors from case-control studies. Here, we have studied genomic variation associated with PD motor severity and early-stage progression in large longitudinal cohorts to help to define the biology of PD progression and potential new drug targets. Methods We performed a GWAS meta-analysis of early PD motor severity and progression up to 3 years from study entry. We used linear mixed-effect models with additive effects, corrected for age at diagnosis, sex, and the first 5 genetic principal components to assess variability in axial, limb, and total Movement Disorder Society--Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III scores. Results We included 3,572 unrelated European ancestry patients with PD from 5 observational cohorts and 1 drug trial. The average AAO was 62.6 years (SD = 9.83), and 63\% of participants were male. We found an average increase in the total MDS-UPDRS III score of 2.3 points/year. We identified an association between PD axial motor progression and variation at the GJA5 locus at 1q12 ({$\beta$} = -0.25, SE = 0.04, p = 3.4e-10). Exploration of the regulation of gene expression in the region (cis-expression quantitative trait loci [eQTL] analysis) showed that the lead variant was associated with expression of ACP6, a lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase that regulates mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis (cis-eQTL p-values in blood and brain RNA expression data sets: {$<$}10-14 in eQTLGen and 10-7 in PsychEncode). Discussion Our study highlights the potential role of mitochondrial lipid homeostasis in the progression of PD, which may be important in establishing new drug targets that might modify disease progression.},

Studies of disease progression feed directly into therapeutics for disease, whereas studies of incidence inform prevention strategies. However, studies of disease progression are known to be affected by collider (also known as "index event") bias since the disease progression phenotype can only be observed for individuals who have the disease. This applies equally to observational and genetic studies, including genome-wide association studies and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. In this paper, our aim is to review several statistical methods that can be used to detect and adjust for index event bias in studies of disease progression, and how they apply to genetic and MR studies using both individual- and summary-level data. Methods to detect the presence of index event bias include the use of negative controls, a comparison of associations between risk factors for incidence in individuals with and without the disease, and an inspection of Miami plots. Methods to adjust for the bias include inverse probability weighting (with individual-level data), or Slope-Hunter and Dudbridge et al.'s index event bias adjustment (when only summary-level data are available).

However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group.

The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent.

METHODS: We conducted a series of systematic literature searches on the pharmacogenetics of HF therapy to assess the current knowledge on this field. RESULTS: Existing data related to HF pharmacogenomics are still limited. The ADRB1 gene is a likely candidate to predict response to {$\beta$}-blockers. Moreover, the cytochrome P450 2D6 coding gene (CYP2D6) clearly affects the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, although the clinical impact of this association remains to be established. CONCLUSION: Given the rising prevalence of HF and related costs, a more personalized use of HF drugs could have a remarkable benefit for patients, caregivers and healthcare systems.},

Participants in each trial were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin or placebo and were followed for a mean of 188.2 weeks. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Results The mean age of the participants was 63.3 years, 35.8\% were women, the mean duration of diabetes was 13.5 years, and 65.6\% had a history of cardiovascular disease. The rate of the primary outcome was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo (occurring in 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.97; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.02 for superiority). Although on the basis of the prespecified hypothesis testing sequence the renal outcomes are not viewed as statistically significant, the results showed a possible benefit of canagliflozin with respect to the progression of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.79) and the composite outcome of a sustained 40\% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, the need for renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal causes (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.47 to 0.77). Adverse reactions were consistent with the previously reported risks associated with canagliflozin except for an increased risk of amputation (6.3 vs. 3.4 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.97; 95\% CI, 1.41 to 2.75); amputations were primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal. Conclusions In two trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, patients treated with canagliflozin had a lower risk of cardiovascular events than those who received placebo but a greater risk of amputation, primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal.

Here we leverage an interim release of UK Biobank (UKBB) data to evaluate the validity of the FDR approach. We tested a CAD phenotype inclusive of angina (SOFT; ncases = 10,801) as well as a stricter definition without angina (HARD; ncases = 6,482) and selected cases with the former phenotype to conduct a meta-analysis using the two most recent CAD GWAS. This approach identified 13 new loci at genome-wide significance, 12 of which were on our previous list of loci meeting the 5\% FDR threshold, thus providing strong support that the remaining loci identified by FDR represent genuine signals. The 304 independent variants associated at 5\% FDR in this study explain 21.2\% of CAD heritability and identify 243 loci that implicate pathways in blood vessel morphogenesis as well as lipid metabolism, nitric oxide signaling and inflammation.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) has been hypothesized to be involved in atherogenesis through pathways related to inflammation. Darapladib is an oral, selective inhibitor of the Lp-PLA2 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of darapladib in patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: SOLID-TIMI 52 was a multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 13,026 participants within 30 days of hospitalization with an ACS (non-ST-elevation or ST-elevation myocardial infarction [MI]) at 868 sites in 36 countries. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to either once-daily darapladib (160 mg) or placebo on a background of guideline-recommended therapy. Patients were followed up for a median of 2.5 years between December 7, 2009, and December 6, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point (major coronary events) was the composite of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, MI, or urgent coronary revascularization for myocardial ischemia. Kaplan-Meier event rates are reported at 3 years. RESULTS: During a median duration of 2.5 years, the primary end point occurred in 903 patients in the darapladib group and 910 in the placebo group (16.3\% vs 15.6\% at 3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.00 [95\% CI, 0.91-1.09]; P\,=\,.93). The composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke occurred in 824 in the darapladib group and 838 in the placebo group (15.0\% vs 15.0\% at 3 years; HR, 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.90-1.09]; P\,=\,.78). There were no differences between the treatment groups for additional secondary end points, for individual components of the primary end point, or in all-cause mortality (371 events in the darapladib group and 395 in the placebo group [7.3\% vs 7.1\% at 3 years; HR, 0.94 [95\% CI, 0.82-1.08]; P\,=\,.40). Patients were more likely to report an odor-related concern in the darapladib group vs the placebo group (11.5\% vs 2.5\%) and also more likely to report diarrhea (10.6\% vs 5.6\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients who experienced an ACS event, direct inhibition of Lp-PLA2 with darapladib added to optimal medical therapy and initiated within 30 days of hospitalization did not reduce the risk of major coronary events.

Subjective well-being, a phenotype that is genetically correlated with both of these traits, has not yet been studied with genome-wide data. We conducted genome-wide association studies of three phenotypes: subjective well-being (n = 298,420), depressive symptoms (n = 161,460), and neuroticism (n = 170,911). We identify 3 variants associated with subjective well-being, 2 variants associated with depressive symptoms, and 11 variants associated with neuroticism, including 2 inversion polymorphisms. The two loci associated with depressive symptoms replicate in an independent depression sample. Joint analyses that exploit the high genetic correlations between the phenotypes ({\textbar}{$\rho$}{\textasciicircum}{\textbar} {$\approx$} 0.8) strengthen the overall credibility of the findings and allow us to identify additional variants. Across our phenotypes, loci regulating expression in central nervous system and adrenal or pancreas tissues are strongly enriched for association.},

Findings from laboratory studies suggest that chronic aldosterone blockade maybe more beneficial in abdominally obese HF-prone rats. In the current study, we investigated if the clinical response to a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in mildly symptomatic HF patients varied by abdominal obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2587 NYHA class II, reduced ejection fraction HF (HFrEF) patients enrolled in the EMPHASIS-HF trial were randomly assigned to eplerenone and placebo. In this post hoc analysis, patients were categorized according to waist circumference (WC) (normal if WC {$<$} 102\,cm in men and\,{$<$}\,88\,cm in women; abdominal obesity if WC {$\geq$} 102\,cm in men and\,{$\geq$}\,88\,cm women). The potential statistical interaction between the treatment and WC was assessed on the primary endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for HF and other secondary endpoints. Over a median follow-up of 21 months, a significant benefit of eplerenone for the primary outcome was noted in both normal [hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.98, P = 0.03] and increased (HR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.37-0.63, P {$<$} 0.0001) WC subgroups, but the latter patients appeared to receive greater benefit than patients with normal WC (P for interaction = 0.01). This suggests a significant quantitative (treatment effect varies in magnitude by subgroup, but is always in same direction) rather than a qualitative interaction (direction of the treatment effect varies by subgroup) between eplerenone and WC in the adjusted analysis. Mean doses of eplerenone, blood pressure and serum potassium changes and adverse events were similar between WC subgroups. CONCLUSION: In EMPHASIS-HF, eplerenone improved outcomes in HFrEF patients with and without abdominal obesity, although the benefit appeared to be more pronounced among those with abdominal obesity. The findings are potentially hypothesis generating and need to be replicated in other HFrEF populations.},

Tirzepatide, a long-acting agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors, causes considerable weight loss, but data are lacking with respect to its effects on cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS: In this international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 731 patients with heart failure, an ejection fraction of at least 50\%, and a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of at least 30 to receive tirzepatide (up to 15 mg subcutaneously once per week) or placebo for at least 52 weeks. The two primary end points were a composite of adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes or a worsening heart-failure event (assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis) and the change from baseline to 52 weeks in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life). RESULTS: A total of 364 patients were assigned to the tirzepatide group and 367 to the placebo group; the median duration of follow-up was 104 weeks. Adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes or a worsening heart-failure event occurred in 36 patients (9.9\%) in the tirzepatide group and in 56 patients (15.3\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.95; P\,=\,0.026). Worsening heart-failure events occurred in 29 patients (8.0\%) in the tirzepatide group and in 52 patients (14.2\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.34 to 0.85), and adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 8 patients (2.2\%) and 5 patients (1.4\%), respectively (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 4.83). At 52 weeks, the mean ({\textpm}SD) change in the KCCQ-CSS was 19.5{\textpm}1.2 in the tirzepatide group as compared with 12.7{\textpm}1.3 in the placebo group (between-group difference, 6.9; 95\% CI, 3.3 to 10.6; P{$<$}0.001). Adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) leading to discontinuation of the trial drug occurred in 23 patients (6.3\%) in the tirzepatide group and in 5 patients (1.4\%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tirzepatide led to a lower risk of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or worsening heart failure than placebo and improved health status in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity.

One reason for this, we suggest, is that GWAS, to date, have generally not focused on phenotypes that directly relate to the progression of disease and thus speak to disease treatment.},

  abstract = {Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The known determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy only partially explain its variability. The purpose of this study was to estimate heritability of left ventricular mass. The study sample included adults in the original Framingham Heart Study and the Framingham Offspring Study who were not receiving antihypertensive medications and who were free of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, valvular heart disease, and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass among first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, and unrelated spouse pairs were calculated to determine the contribution of heredity to the variability in left ventricular mass. After adjustments for age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure, the intraclass correlations between first-degree relatives were .15 (parent-child, P{$<$}.001) to .16 (siblings, P{$<$}.001), between second-degree relatives the correlation was .06 (P=NS), and between spouses it was .05 (P=NS). The estimated heritability of adjusted left ventricular mass was between .24 and .32. The proportion of the variance in sex-specific left ventricular mass explained by age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure was .26 in men and .34 in women. On the basis of intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass, incorporation of adjusted left ventricular mass of a parent or sibling would increase the explained variance by an additional .02 to .03. Heredity explains a small, but discernible proportion of the variance in left ventricular mass. Studies are currently under way to identify genetic markers that predict an individual's predisposition to left ventricular hypertrophy. This knowledge may lead to advances in the prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

Epidemiological studies indicate that the location and distribution of excess fat, rather than general adiposity, are more informative for predicting risk of obesity sequelae, including cardiometabolic disease and cancer. We performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of body fat distribution, measured by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (WHRadjBMI), and identified 463 signals in 346 loci. Heritability and variant effects were generally stronger in women than men, and we found approximately one-third of all signals to be sexually dimorphic. The 5\% of individuals carrying the most WHRadjBMI-increasing alleles were 1.62 times more likely than the bottom 5\% to have a WHR above the thresholds used for metabolic syndrome. These data, made publicly available, will inform the biology of body fat distribution and its relationship with disease.},

  abstract = {Approximately half of patients with heart failure have preserved ejection fraction. There is no proven treatment that improves outcome. The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is complex and includes left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary vascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, and peripheral abnormalities. Multiple lines of evidence point to impaired nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP bioavailability as playing a central role in each of these abnormalities. In contrast to traditional organic nitrate therapies, an alternative strategy to restore NO-cGMP signaling is via inorganic nitrite. Inorganic nitrite, previously considered to be an inert byproduct of NO metabolism, functions as an important in vivo reservoir for NO generation, particularly under hypoxic and acidosis conditions. As such, inorganic nitrite becomes most active at times of greater need for NO signaling, as during exercise when left ventricular filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures increase. Herein, we present the rationale and design for the INDIE-HFpEF trial (Inorganic Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction), which is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study assessing the effect of inhaled inorganic nitrite on peak exercise capacity, conducted in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored Heart Failure Clinical Research Network.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Studies in experimental and human heart failure suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors may enhance cardiovascular function and thus exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with placebo on exercise capacity and clinical status in HFPEF. DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 216 stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction {$\geq$}50\%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity. Participants were randomized from October 2008 through February 2012 at 26 centers in North America. Follow-up was through August 30, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Sildenafil (n = 113) or placebo (n = 103) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point was change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included change in 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite clinical status score (range, 1-n, a higher value indicates better status; expected value with no treatment effect, 95) based on time to death, time to cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization, and change in quality of life for participants without cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization at 24 weeks. RESULTS: Median age was 69 years, and 48\% of patients were women. At baseline, median peak oxygen consumption (11.7 mL/kg/min) and 6-minute walk distance (308 m) were reduced. The median E/e' (16), left atrial volume index (44 mL/m2), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (41 mm Hg) were consistent with chronically elevated left ventricular filling pressures. At 24 weeks, median (IQR) changes in peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) in patients who received placebo (-0.20 [IQR, -0.70 to 1.00]) or sildenafil (-0.20 [IQR, -1.70 to 1.11]) were not significantly different (P = .90) in analyses in which patients with missing week-24 data were excluded, and in sensitivity analysis based on intention to treat with multiple imputation for missing values (mean between-group difference, 0.01 mL/kg/min, [95\% CI, -0.60 to 0.61]). The mean clinical status rank score was not significantly different at 24 weeks between placebo (95.8) and sildenafil (94.2) (P = .85). Changes in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks in patients who received placebo (15.0 m [IQR, -26.0 to 45.0]) or sildenafil (5.0 m [IQR, -37.0 to 55.0]; P = .92) were also not significantly different. Adverse events occurred in 78 placebo patients (76\%) and 90 sildenafil patients (80\%). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 placebo patients (16\%) and 25 sildenafil patients (22\%). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with HFPEF, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with administration of sildenafil for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity or clinical status.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nitrates are commonly prescribed to enhance activity tolerance in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction. We compared the effect of isosorbide mononitrate or placebo on daily activity in such patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, crossover study, 110 patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction were randomly assigned to a 6-week dose-escalation regimen of isosorbide mononitrate (from 30 mg to 60 mg to 120 mg once daily) or placebo, with subsequent crossover to the other group for 6 weeks. The primary end point was the daily activity level, quantified as the average daily accelerometer units during the 120-mg phase, as assessed by patient-worn accelerometers. Secondary end points included hours of activity per day during the 120-mg phase, daily accelerometer units during all three dose regimens, quality-of-life scores, 6-minute walk distance, and levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). RESULTS: In the group receiving the 120-mg dose of isosorbide mononitrate, as compared with the placebo group, there was a nonsignificant trend toward lower daily activity (-381 accelerometer units; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -780 to 17; P=0.06) and a significant decrease in hours of activity per day (-0.30 hours; 95\% CI, -0.55 to -0.05; P=0.02). During all dose regimens, activity in the isosorbide mononitrate group was lower than that in the placebo group (-439 accelerometer units; 95\% CI, -792 to -86; P=0.02). Activity levels decreased progressively and significantly with increased doses of isosorbide mononitrate (but not placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in the 6-minute walk distance, quality-of-life scores, or NT-proBNP levels. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction who received isosorbide mononitrate were less active and did not have better quality of life or submaximal exercise capacity than did patients who received placebo.

BACKGROUND: Limited data regarding the prognostic impact of BMI in patients with HFmrEF is available. METHODS: Consecutive patients with HFmrEF (ie, left ventricular ejection fraction 41-49\% and signs and/or symptoms of HF) were retrospectively included at one institution from 2016 to 2022. Risk stratification was performed according to WHO-defined BMI groups. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 months (median follow-up). Kaplan-Meier, uni- and multivariable Cox proportional regression analyses were applied for statistics. RESULTS: 1832 consecutive patients with HFmrEF were included with a median BMI of 26.7 kg/m2 (IQR 24.0-30.8 kg/m2). Patients with lowest BMI (ie, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) were associated with highest risk of all-cause mortality at 30 months compared to patients with higher BMI values (40.0\% vs 29.0\% vs 21.4\% vs 20.9\%; log rank p = 0.001; HR = 0.721; 95\% CI 0.656-0.793; p = 0.001). Even after multivariable adjustment, higher BMI values were associated with improved survival at 30 months (HR = 0.963; 95\% CI 0.943-0.985; p = 0.001). In contrast, the risk of HF- related rehospitalization at 30 months was not affected by BMI (log rank p = 0.064). CONCLUSION: In patients hospitalized with HFmrEF, lower BMI was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30 months, suggesting an obesity paradox in HFmrEF.},

The aim of this study was to determine the heritability of circulating ACE, ACE2, and neprilysin (NEP), which may also be a regulator of BP, in a family study, and to determine covariates that contribute to the variation in plasma activity. ACE, ACE2, and NEP activities were measured in plasma from 534 subjects in the Leeds Family Study using selective fluorogenic substrates. Genetic factors accounted for 24.5\%, 67\%, and 22.7\% of the phenotypic variation in circulating ACE, ACE2, and NEP, respectively. ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism and other measured covariates accounted for 23.8\% of variance in circulating ACE. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was a significant determinant of circulating ACE2. Measured covariates accounted for 17.3\% of variation in circulating NEP. ACE and NEP were associated with systolic and diastolic BP in univariate analyses; however, only ACE was independently associated with systolic and diastolic BP after accounting for covariates and shared childhood household.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modifiable lifestyle factors in relation to risk for cardiomyopathy, a common and increasing cause of heart failure in the young, have not been widely studied. We sought to investigate a potential link between obesity, a recognized predictor of early heart failure, in adolescence and being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in adulthood. METHODS: This was a nationwide register-based prospective cohort study of 1\,668\,893 adolescent men (mean age, 18.3 years; SD, 0.7 years) who enlisted for compulsory military service from 1969 to 2005. At baseline, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and medical disorders were registered, along with test results for fitness and muscle strength. Cardiomyopathy diagnoses were identified from the National Hospital Register and Cause of Death Register during an up to 46-year follow-up and divided into categories: dilated, hypertrophic, alcohol/drug-induced, and other. Hazard ratios were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 27 years; Q1-Q3, 19-35 years), 4477 cases of cardiomyopathy were identified, of which 2631 (59\%) were dilated, 673 (15\%) were hypertrophic, and 480 (11\%) were alcohol/drug-induced. Increasing BMI was strongly associated with elevated risk of cardiomyopathy, especially dilated, starting at levels considered normal (BMI, 22.5-{$<$}25 kg/m2; hazard ratio, 1.38 [95\% CI, 1.22-1.57]), adjusted for age, year, center, and baseline comorbidities, and with a {$>$}8-fold increased risk at BMI {$\geq$}35 kg/m2 compared with BMI of 18.5 to {$<$}20 kg/m2. For each 1-unit increase in BMI, similarly adjusted hazard ratios were 1.15 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.17) for dilated cardiomyopathy, 1.09 (95\% CI, 1.06-1.12) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 1.10 (1.06-1.13) for alcohol/drug-induced cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Even mildly elevated body weight in late adolescence may contribute to being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in adulthood. The already marked importance of weight control in youth is further strengthened by these findings, as well as greater evidence for obesity as a potential important cause of adverse cardiac remodeling that is independent of clinically evident ischemic heart disease.},

  abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Rapid progression of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Most previous studies looking for genetic factors associated with low eGFR have used cross-sectional data. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD, focusing on longitudinal data. They identified three loci (two of them novel) associated with longitudinal eGFR decline. In addition to the known UMOD/PDILT locus, variants within BICC1 were associated with significant differences in longitudinal eGFR slope. Variants within HEATR4 also were associated with differences in eGFR decline, but only among Black/African American individuals without diabetes. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline in CKD and may inform new therapeutic approaches for progressive kidney disease. BACKGROUND: Rapid progression of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite extensive study of the genetics of cross-sectional eGFR, only a few loci associated with eGFR decline over time have been identified. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD-defined by two outpatient eGFR measurements of {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , obtained 90-365 days apart-from the Million Veteran Program and Vanderbilt University Medical Center's DNA biobank. The primary outcome was the annualized relative slope in outpatient eGFR. Analyses were stratified by ethnicity and diabetes status and meta-analyzed thereafter. RESULTS: In cross-ancestry meta-analysis, the strongest association was rs77924615, near UMOD / PDILT ; each copy of the G allele was associated with a 0.30\%/yr faster eGFR decline ( P = 4.9{\texttimes}10 -27 ). We also observed an association within BICC1 (rs11592748), where every additional minor allele was associated with a 0.13\%/yr slower eGFR decline ( P = 5.6{\texttimes}10 -9 ). Among participants without diabetes, the strongest association was the UMOD/PDILT variant rs36060036, associated with a 0.27\%/yr faster eGFR decline per copy of the C allele ( P = 1.9{\texttimes}10 -17 ). Among Black participants, a significantly faster eGFR decline was associated with variant rs16996674 near APOL1 (R 2 =0.29 with the G1 high-risk genotype); among Black participants with diabetes, lead variant rs11624911 near HEATR4 also was associated with a significantly faster eGFR decline. We also nominally replicated loci with known associations with eGFR decline, near PRKAG2, FGF5, and C15ORF54. CONCLUSIONS: Three loci were significantly associated with longitudinal eGFR change at genome-wide significance. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for progressive CKD.},

Results~           In cross-ancestry meta-analysis, the strongest association was rs77924615, near UMOD/PDILT; each copy of the G allele was associated with a 0.30\%/yr faster eGFR decline (P = 4.9{\texttimes}10-27). We also observed an association within BICC1 (rs11592748), where every additional minor allele was associated with a 0.13\%/yr slower eGFR decline (P = 5.6{\texttimes}10-9). Among participants without diabetes, the strongest association was the UMOD/PDILT variant rs36060036, associated with a 0.27\%/yr faster eGFR decline per copy of the C allele (P = 1.9{\texttimes}10-17). Among Black participants, a significantly faster eGFR decline was associated with variant rs16996674 near APOL1 (R2=0.29 with the G1 high-risk genotype); among Black participants with diabetes, lead variant rs11624911 near HEATR4 also was associated with a significantly faster eGFR decline. We also nominally replicated loci with known associations with eGFR decline, near PRKAG2, FGF5, and C15ORF54.           Conclusions~           Three loci were significantly associated with longitudinal eGFR change at genome-wide significance. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for progressive CKD.

  abstract = {Objectives This study sought to define the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality in heart failure (HF) across the world and to identify specific groups in whom BMI may differentially mediate risk. Background Obesity is associated with incident HF, but it is paradoxically associated with better prognosis during chronic HF. Methods We studied 6,142 patients with acute decompensated HF from 12 prospective observational cohorts followed-up across 4 continents. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models and net reclassification index described associations of BMI with all-cause mortality. Results Normal-weight patients (BMI 18.5 to 25 kg/m2) were older with more advanced HF and lower cardiometabolic risk. Despite worldwide heterogeneity in clinical features across obesity categories, a higher BMI remained associated with decreased 30-day and 1-year mortality (11\% decrease at 30 days; 9\% decrease at 1 year per 5 kg/m2; p~{$<~$}0.05), after adjustment for clinical risk. The BMI obtained at index admission provided effective 1-year risk reclassification beyond current markers of clinical risk (net reclassification index 0.119, p~{$<$} 0.001). Notably, the ``protective'' association of BMI with mortality was confined to persons with older age ({$>$}75 years; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; p~= 0.006), decreased cardiac function (ejection fraction~{$<$}50\%; HR: 0.85; p~{$<$} 0.001), no diabetes (HR: 0.86; p~{$<$} 0.001), and de novo HF (HR: 0.89; p~= 0.004). Conclusions A lower BMI is associated with age, disease severity, and a higher risk of death in acute decompensated HF. The ``obesity paradox'' is confined to older persons, with decreased cardiac function, less cardiometabolic illness, and recent-onset HF, suggesting that aging, HF severity/chronicity, and metabolism may explain the obesity paradox.},

A small proportion of HF cases are attributable to monogenic cardiomyopathies and existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded only limited insights, leaving the observed heritability of HF largely unexplained. We report results from a GWAS meta-analysis of HF comprising 47,309 cases and 930,014 controls. Twelve independent variants at 11 genomic loci are associated with HF, all of which demonstrate one or more associations with coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, or reduced left ventricular function, suggesting shared genetic aetiology. Functional analysis of non-CAD-associated loci implicate genes involved in cardiac development (MYOZ1, SYNPO2L), protein homoeostasis (BAG3), and cellular senescence (CDKN1A). Mendelian randomisation analysis supports causal roles for several HF risk factors, and demonstrates CAD-independent effects for atrial fibrillation, body mass index, and~hypertension. These findings extend our knowledge of the pathways underlying HF and may inform new therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although genetic factors contribute to the onset of heart failure (HF), no large-scale genome-wide investigation of HF risk has been published to date. We have investigated the association of 2,478,304 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with incident HF by meta-analyzing data from 4 community-based prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eligible participants for these analyses were of European or African ancestry and free of clinical HF at baseline. Each study independently conducted genome-wide scans and imputed data to the approximately 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HapMap. Within each study, Cox proportional hazards regression models provided age- and sex-adjusted estimates of the association between each variant and time to incident HF. Fixed-effect meta-analyses combined results for each single-nucleotide polymorphism from the 4 cohorts to produce an overall association estimate and P value. A genome-wide significance P value threshold was set a priori at 5.0x10(-7). During a mean follow-up of 11.5 years, 2526 incident HF events (12\%) occurred in 20 926 European-ancestry participants. The meta-analysis identified a genome-wide significant locus at chromosomal position 15q22 (1.4x10(-8)), which was 58.8 kb from USP3. Among 2895 African-ancestry participants, 466 incident HF events (16\%) occurred during a mean follow-up of 13.7 years. One genome-wide significant locus was identified at 12q14 (6.7x10(-8)), which was 6.3 kb from LRIG3. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 2 loci that were associated with incident HF and exceeded genome-wide significance. The findings merit replication in other community-based settings of incident HF.},

  abstract = {Failure of the human heart to maintain sufficient output of blood for the demands of the body, heart failure, is a common condition with high mortality even with modern therapeutic alternatives. To identify molecular determinants of mortality in patients with new-onset heart failure, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies and follow-up genotyping in independent populations. We identified and replicated an association for a genetic variant on chromosome 5q22 with 36\% increased risk of death in subjects with heart failure (rs9885413, P = 2.7x10-9). We provide evidence from reporter gene assays, computational predictions and epigenomic marks that this polymorphism increases activity of an enhancer region active in multiple human tissues. The polymorphism was further reproducibly associated with a DNA methylation signature in whole blood (P = 4.5x10-40) that also associated with allergic sensitization and expression in blood of the cytokine TSLP (P = 1.1x10-4). Knockdown of the transcription factor predicted to bind the enhancer region (NHLH1) in a human cell line (HEK293) expressing NHLH1 resulted in lower TSLP expression. In addition, we observed evidence of recent positive selection acting on the risk allele in populations of African descent. Our findings provide novel genetic leads to factors that influence mortality in patients with heart failure.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Numerous studies have demonstrated that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a primary role in CVD development. Therefore, studies on the mechanisms of ncRNAs are essential for further efforts to prevent and treat CVDs. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a novel species of non-conventional ncRNAs that guide post-transcriptional modifications and the subsequent maturation of small nuclear RNA and ribosomal RNA. Evidently, snoRNAs are extensively expressed in human tissues and may regulate different illnesses. Particularly, as the next-generation sequencing techniques have progressed, snoRNAs have been shown to be differentially expressed in CVDs, suggesting that they may play a role in the occurrence and progression of cardiac illnesses. However, the molecular processes and signaling pathways underlying the function of snoRNAs remain unidentified. Therefore, it is of great value to comprehensively investigate the association between snoRNAs and CVDs. The aim of this review was to collate existing literature on the biogenesis, characteristics, and potential regulatory mechanisms of snoRNAs. In particular, we present a scientific update on these snoRNAs and their relevance to CVDs in an effort to cast new light on the functions of snoRNAs in the clinical diagnosis of CVDs.},

For PRA and AGT significant heritability was only detected in the male subgroup, with heritability estimates of 66\% and 90\%, respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme concentration was determined by additive genes for 43\% of its variance, by shared environmental influences for 42\%, and by specific environmental influences for 15\%. The high heritability found for AGT is compatible with the results of earlier studies linking the M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene to plasma AGT levels. For PRA, we are the first to show significant heritability. Our results regarding ACE confirm the findings in other populations.},

  abstract = {Objective The aim of this study was to obtain estimates of the causal relationship between BMI and mortality. Methods Mendelian randomization (MR) with BMI-associated genotypic variation was used to test the causal effect of BMI on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in UK Biobank participants of White British ancestry. Results MR analyses supported a causal association between higher BMI and greater risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 kg/m2: 1.03; 95\% CI: 0.99-1.07) and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (HR: 1.10; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.19), specifically coronary heart disease (HR: 1.12; 95\% CI: 1.00-1.25) and those excluding coronary heart disease/stroke/aortic aneurysm (HR: 1.24; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.48), stomach cancer (HR: 1.18; 95\% CI: 0.87-1.62), and esophageal cancer (HR: 1.22; 95\% CI: 0.98-1.53), and a decreased risk of lung cancer mortality (HR: 0.96; 95\% CI: 0.85-1.08). Sex stratification supported the causal role of higher BMI increasing bladder cancer mortality risk (males) but decreasing respiratory disease mortality risk (males). The J-shaped observational association between BMI and mortality was visible with MR analyses, but the BMI at which mortality was minimized was lower and the association was flatter over a larger BMI range. Conclusions Results support a causal role of higher BMI in increasing the risk of all-cause mortality and mortality from several specific causes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular safety profile of dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 that promotes glucosuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, is undefined. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to receive either dapagliflozin or placebo. The primary safety outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. The primary efficacy outcomes were MACE and a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary efficacy outcomes were a renal composite ({$\geq$}40\% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate to {$<$}60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, new end-stage renal disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes) and death from any cause. RESULTS: We evaluated 17,160 patients, including 10,186 without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who were followed for a median of 4.2 years. In the primary safety outcome analysis, dapagliflozin met the prespecified criterion for noninferiority to placebo with respect to MACE (upper boundary of the 95\% confidence interval [CI], {$<$}1.3; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority). In the two primary efficacy analyses, dapagliflozin did not result in a lower rate of MACE (8.8\% in the dapagliflozin group and 9.4\% in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.84 to 1.03; P=0.17) but did result in a lower rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (4.9\% vs. 5.8\%; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P=0.005), which reflected a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.61 to 0.88); there was no between-group difference in cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.17). A renal event occurred in 4.3\% in the dapagliflozin group and in 5.6\% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.87), and death from any cause occurred in 6.2\% and 6.6\%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.04). Diabetic ketoacidosis was more common with dapagliflozin than with placebo (0.3\% vs. 0.1\%, P=0.02), as was the rate of genital infections that led to discontinuation of the regimen or that were considered to be serious adverse events (0.9\% vs. 0.1\%, P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, treatment with dapagliflozin did not result in a higher or lower rate of MACE than placebo but did result in a lower rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, a finding that reflects a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure.

  abstract = {Recent genetic studies have identified some alleles that are associated with higher BMI but lower risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. These "favorable adiposity" alleles are collectively associated with lower insulin levels and higher subcutaneous-to-visceral adipose tissue ratio and may protect from disease through higher adipose storage capacity. We aimed to use data from 164,609 individuals from the UK Biobank and five other studies to replicate associations between a genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants and adiposity and risk of disease, to test for interactions between BMI and favorable adiposity genetics, and to test effects separately in men and women. In the UK Biobank, the 50\% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles had higher BMIs (0.120 kg/m(2) [95\% CI 0.066, 0.174]; P = 1E-5) and higher body fat percentage (0.301\% [0.230, 0.372]; P = 1E-16) compared with the 50\% of individuals carrying the fewest alleles. For a given BMI, the 50\% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles were at lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.837 [0.784, 0.894]; P = 1E-7), hypertension (OR 0.935 [0.911, 0.958]; P = 1E-7), and heart disease (OR 0.921 [0.872, 0.973]; P = 0.003) and had lower blood pressure (systolic -0.859 mmHg [-1.099, -0.618]; P = 3E-12 and diastolic -0.394 mmHg [-0.534, -0.254]; P = 4E-8). In women, these associations could be explained by the observation that the alleles associated with higher BMI but lower risk of disease were also associated with a favorable body fat distribution, with a lower waist-to-hip ratio (-0.004 cm [95\% CI -0.005, -0.003] 50\% vs. 50\%; P = 3E-14), but in men, the favorable adiposity alleles were associated with higher waist circumference (0.454 cm [0.267, 0.641] 50\% vs. 50\%; P = 2E-6) and higher waist-to-hip ratio (0.0013 [0.0003, 0.0024] 50\% vs. 50\%; P = 0.01). Results were strengthened when a meta-analysis with five additional studies was conducted. There was no evidence of interaction between a genetic score consisting of known BMI variants and the favorable adiposity genetic score. In conclusion, different molecular mechanisms that lead to higher body fat percentage (with greater subcutaneous storage capacity) can have different impacts on cardiometabolic disease risk. Although higher BMI is associated with higher risk of diseases, better fat storage capacity could reduce the risk.},

  abstract = {Family- and population-based genetic studies have successfully identified multiple disease-susceptibility loci for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the first batch and most successful examples of genome-wide association study. However, most genetic studies to date have focused on case--control studies of late AMD (choroidal neovascularization or geographic atrophy). The genetic influences on disease progression are largely unexplored. We assembled unique resources to perform a genome-wide bivariate time-to-event analysis to test for association of time-to-late-AMD with {$\sim$}9 million variants on 2721 Caucasians from a large multi-center randomized clinical trial, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide association study of disease progression (bivariate survival outcome) in AMD genetic studies, thus providing novel insights to AMD genetics. We used a robust Cox proportional hazards model to appropriately account for between-eye correlation when analyzing the progression time in the two eyes of each participant. We identified four previously reported susceptibility loci showing genome-wide significant association with AMD progression: ARMS2-HTRA1 (P\,=\,8.1 {\texttimes} 10-43), CFH (P = 3.5 {\texttimes} 10-37), C2-CFB-SKIV2L (P = 8.1 {\texttimes} 10-10) and C3 (P = 1.2 {\texttimes} 10-9). Furthermore, we detected association of rs58978565 near TNR (P = 2.3 {\texttimes} 10-8), rs28368872 near ATF7IP2 (P = 2.9 {\texttimes} 10-8) and rs142450006 near MMP9 (P = 0.0006) with progression to choroidal neovascularization but not geographic atrophy. Secondary analysis limited to 34 reported risk variants revealed that LIPC and CTRB2-CTRB1 were also associated with AMD progression (P {$<$} 0.0015). Our genome-wide analysis thus expands the genetics in both development and progression of AMD and should assist in early identification of high risk individuals.},

  abstract = {Understanding disease progression is of a high biological and clinical interest. Unlike disease susceptibility whose genetic basis has been abundantly studied, less is known about the genetics of disease progression and its overlap with disease susceptibility. Considering ten common diseases (N cases ranging from 17,152 to 99,666) across seven biobanks, we systematically compared the genetic architecture of susceptibility and progression, defined as disease-specific mortality. We identified only one locus significantly associated with disease-specific mortality and show that, at a similar sample size, more genome-wide significant loci can be identified in a GWAS of disease susceptibility. Variants that were significantly affecting disease susceptibility were weakly or not associated with disease-specific mortality. Moreover, susceptibility polygenic scores (PGSs) were weak predictor of disease-specific mortality while a PGS for general lifespan was significantly associated with disease-specific mortality for five out of ten diseases. We used theoretical derivation and simulation to propose plausible explanations for our empirical observations and account for potential index-event bias. Overall, our findings point to little similarity in genetic effects between disease susceptibility and disease-specific mortality and suggest that either larger sample sizes or different measures of progression are needed to identify the genetic underpinning of disease progression.},

Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in {$\sim$}450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N~{$\sim$}700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P~{$<~$}1~{\texttimes}~10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain {$\sim$}24.6\% of the variance of height and {$\sim$}6.0\% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were {$\sim$}0.44 and {$\sim$}0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology.

In previous studies of patients with CHF and low LVEF or vascular disease and preserved LVEF, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is beneficial. We investigated the effect of addition of an angiotensin-receptor blocker to current treatments. METHODS: Between March, 1999, and July, 2000, we randomly assigned 3023 patients candesartan (n=1514, target dose 32 mg once daily) or matching placebo (n=1509). Patients had New York Heart Association functional class II-IV CHF and LVEF higher than 40\%. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or admission to hospital for CHF. Analysis was done by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Median follow-up was 36.6 months. 333 (22\%) patients in the candesartan and 366 (24\%) in the placebo group experienced the primary outcome (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.89 [95\% CI 0.77-1.03], p=0.118; covariate adjusted 0.86 [0.74-1.0], p=0.051). Cardiovascular death did not differ between groups (170 vs 170), but fewer patients in the candesartan group than in the placebo group were admitted to hospital for CHF once (230 vs 279, p=0.017) or multiple times. Composite outcomes that included non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke showed similar results to the primary composite (388 vs 429; unadjusted 0.88 [0.77-1.01], p=0.078; covariate adjusted 0.86 [0.75-0.99], p=0.037).

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mendelian randomization (MR) is a strategy for evaluating causality in observational epidemiological studies. MR exploits the fact that genotypes are not generally susceptible to reverse causation and confounding, due to their fixed nature and Mendel's First and Second Laws of Inheritance. MR has the potential to provide information on causality in many situations where randomized controlled trials are not possible, but the results of MR studies must be interpreted carefully to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we outline the principles behind MR, as well as assumptions and limitations of the method. Extensions to the basic approach are discussed, including two-sample MR, bidirectional MR, two-step MR, multivariable MR, and factorial MR. We also consider some new applications and recent developments in the methodology, including its ability to inform drug development, automation of the method using tools such as MR-Base, and phenome-wide and hypothesis-free MR. SUMMARY: In conjunction with the growing availability of large-scale genomic databases, higher level of automation and increased robustness of the methods, MR promises to be a valuable strategy to examine causality in complex biological/omics networks, inform drug development and prioritize intervention targets for disease prevention in the future.},

  abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a rapidly growing public health issue with an estimated prevalence of {$>$}37.7 million individuals globally. HF is a shared chronic phase of cardiac functional impairment secondary to many aetiologies, and patients with HF experience numerous symptoms that affect their quality of life, including dyspnoea, fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, and fluid retention. Although the underlying causes of HF vary according to sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, and environment, the majority of cases remain preventable. HF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and confers a substantial burden to the health-care system. HF is a leading cause of hospitalization among adults and the elderly. In the USA, the total medical costs for patients with HF are expected to rise from US\$20.9 billion in 2012 to \$53.1 billion by 2030. Improvements in the medical management of risk factors and HF have stabilized the incidence of this disease in many countries. In this Review, we provide an overview of the latest epidemiological data on HF, and propose future directions for reducing the ever-increasing HF burden.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effects of empagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, in addition to standard care, on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk are not known. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients to receive 10 mg or 25 mg of empagliflozin or placebo once daily. The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, as analyzed in the pooled empagliflozin group versus the placebo group. The key secondary composite outcome was the primary outcome plus hospitalization for unstable angina. RESULTS: A total of 7020 patients were treated (median observation time, 3.1 years). The primary outcome occurred in 490 of 4687 patients (10.5\%) in the pooled empagliflozin group and in 282 of 2333 patients (12.1\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.86; 95.02\% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99; P=0.04 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of myocardial infarction or stroke, but in the empagliflozin group there were significantly lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes (3.7\%, vs. 5.9\% in the placebo group; 38\% relative risk reduction), hospitalization for heart failure (2.7\% and 4.1\%, respectively; 35\% relative risk reduction), and death from any cause (5.7\% and 8.3\%, respectively; 32\% relative risk reduction). There was no significant between-group difference in the key secondary outcome (P=0.08 for superiority). Among patients receiving empagliflozin, there was an increased rate of genital infection but no increase in other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events who received empagliflozin, as compared with placebo, had a lower rate of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome and of death from any cause when the study drug was added to standard care.
